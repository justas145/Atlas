AT: At waypoint add a alt/speed VNAV constraint or add a command to the stack to be issued when passing
Edit, delete or show speed or altitude constraints at a waypoint in the route. It can also be used to make a list of command lines to be issued when the waypoint in the flight plan is passed by the aircraft before the AT.

Examples:
KL204 AT LOPIK ALT FL100  => at this waypoint the altitude will be FL100 (depending on other constraints, it will descend as late as possible and climb as soon as possible along the route)
KL204 AT LOPIK SPD 250  =>at this waypoint will set the speed to 250 kts
KL204 AT LOPIK FL100/250 => does both the above in one go
KL204 AT LOPIK DO ECHO HELLO WORLD => "ECHO HELLO WORLD" will be issued when this waypoint is passed by KL204
KL204 AT LOPIK DO HDG 270 => will issue "KL204 HDG 270:" when KL204 passes this waypoint 
KL204 AT LOPIK DO KLM1705 DIRECT SPY => will issue "KLM1705 DIRECT SPY" when KL204 passes this waypoint (offers lots of interactions!) 
KL204 AT LOPIK STACK ECHO HELLO WORLD => "ECHO HELLO WORLD" will be issued when this waypoint is passed by KL204 (so same as first)
KL204 AT LOPIK  => shows everything entered at this waypoint\
