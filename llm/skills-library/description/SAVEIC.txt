SAVEIC: Save initial condition and start recording a scenario file
Save the current state of the simulator in a scenario file and start recording from now on. Timestamps in the recorded scenario file will be relative to the time of the SAVEIC command. This allows the BlueSky console to be used as a scenario editor.
Scenario files are text files with the extension .scn. They contain commands with a time stamp, e.g:
00:00:00.00>KL204 HDG 270
The recorded scenario file can be played with the IC command. and again cumulatively edited and recorded if necessary.
By default a number of commands are not recorded (PAN,ZOOM,HOLD,POS,INSEDIT,SAVEIC, QUIT). With SAVEIC EXCEPT NONE this list is erased (except for bare minimum INSEDIT and SAVEIC).
The PCALL command is also not recorded itself, but all commands from the called file(s) will be recorded as well
Usage:
SAVEIC filename
SAVEIC CLOSE
SAVEIC EXCEPT command command command ...
SAVEIC EXCEPT NONE
SAVEIC EXCEPT
