AREA: Area
Define an area of interest.
When an aircraft exits the area, it is deleted from the simulation. It is possible to predefine shapes using the BOX, CIRCLE, POLY and POLYALT commands.
This argument can be called in two ways:

using the name of an already existing shape
as a square shape

Note that shapes/areas defined in the second way can be 2D (without altitude constraints) or 3D (with altitude constraints).
Usage:
AREA Shapename/OFF or AREA lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2,[top,bottom]
