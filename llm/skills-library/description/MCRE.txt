[1] If no aircraft type is given, the Boeing 744 is used.
[2] Altitude can be given as altitude [ft] or flight level [-]. In order to give the altitude as flight level, use the letters "FL". If no altitude is given, a random altitude is selected in the interval [2000, 39000] ft.
[3] Speed can be given as Calibrated Airspeed [kts] or Mach number [-]. If no speed is given, a random CAS is selected in the interval [250, 450] kts.
[4] This functionality is not implemented yet.
