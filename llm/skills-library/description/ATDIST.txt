ATDIST: acid ATDIST pos dist command
When an aircraft reaches a given distance to the given position, execute the given command. Reaching the distance is detected by a sign change of the difference between current value and target value of the condition. So it works from within and from outside, but only once
The issued command can be any command for any a/c id. It could even be another ATDIST command which will only be active after reaching this distance (i.e. to something upon returning to the specified range circle).
