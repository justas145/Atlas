Invoking: `GETCONFLICTINFO` with `{'command': 'SHOWTCPA'}`


Aircraft Pairs in Conflict and their TCPA (sec):
FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2 | TCPA: 282.50 sec | QDR: 112.50 deg | Distance: 30.26 Nautical miles | DCPA: 0.00 Nautical miles | tLOS: 235.83 sec
Number of aircraft in conflict: 2
Since there is a conflict, I need to provide an actionable plan to resolve the conflict.

To resolve the conflict, I recommend the following:

Instruct FLIGHT1 to descend to 19000 ft. This will provide a vertical separation of 1000 ft, which meets the ICAO standard.

NO FURTHER TOOL CALLS NEEDED.
