Since the conflict has been resolved, I'll respond directly without using a tool.

It appears that the conflict has been resolved successfully. The aircraft are now separated by more than 2000 ft vertically.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 29300'}`
responded: Currently, there are no conflicts detected between the aircraft. However, let's review the aircraft information to ensure no potential conflicts might arise due to vertical speed changes.

### Aircraft Information:
1. **FLIGHT1**
   - Position: S55'28'50.0"" E059'22'9.0""
   - Heading: 194°
   - Altitude: 27300 ft
   - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)

2. **FLIGHT2**
   - Position: S56'00'11.0"" E058'49'56.0""
   - Heading: 044°
   - Altitude: 27937 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -600 fpm (descending)

### Analysis:
- FLIGHT1 is maintaining a level flight at 27300 ft.
- FLIGHT2 is descending at 600 fpm and currently at 27937 ft.

Given the current vertical speeds and altitudes:
- FLIGHT2 will reach FLIGHT1's altitude (27300 ft) in approximately \((27937 - 27300) / 600 \approx 1.06\) minutes.
- This descent might lead to a conflict if the horizontal separation is not maintained.

To ensure separation, we can command FLIGHT2 to level off at a higher altitude to maintain vertical separation.

### Command:
- **FLIGHT2**: Level off at 29300 ft to ensure a 2000 ft vertical separation from FLIGHT1.

Let's send the command to FLIGHT2.

Command executed successfully.
Invoking: `CONTINUEMONITORING` with `{'duration': 8}`
responded: The command to level off FLIGHT2 at 29300 ft has been executed successfully. This should ensure a vertical separation of 2000 ft from FLIGHT1, thus preventing any potential conflicts.

I will now monitor the situation for a short period to ensure no new conflicts arise.

No conflicts detected.

 After 8 seconds 
No conflicts detected.
The monitoring period has concluded, and no conflicts were detected. The airspace is currently conflict-free with the adjustments made.

If you need further assistance or monitoring, please let me know!

It seems that there are no more conflicts between the aircraft. The vertical separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 is more than 2000 ft, and the horizontal separation is more than 5 nautical miles. Therefore, no further action is needed to solve the conflict.

responded: Both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude of 31,400 feet with no vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their current altitude. To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 feet or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Given that the current horizontal distance is 25.69 nautical miles and the DCPA is 0.12 nautical miles, vertical separation is the most immediate solution.

Let's change the altitude of one of the aircraft to create the required vertical separation. I'll command FLIGHT1 to climb to 33,400 feet.

No conflicts detected.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 20800'}`
responded: Currently, there are no conflicts detected between the aircraft. However, we need to ensure that the vertical separation requirement is maintained, especially since FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are both descending and are at the same altitude.

### Aircraft Information:
- **FLIGHT1**: 
  - Altitude: 22,200 ft
  - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)
- **FLIGHT2**: 
  - Altitude: 22,800 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -507 fpm (descending)
- **FLIGHT3**: 
  - Altitude: 22,800 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -576 fpm (descending)

Since FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are both descending and at the same altitude, they will likely violate the vertical separation requirement soon. We need to change the altitude of one of these aircraft to ensure separation.

### Command to Resolve Potential Conflict:
We will instruct FLIGHT2 to descend to 20,800 ft to ensure a 2000 ft vertical separation from FLIGHT3.

Let's send the command to FLIGHT2:

### Current Situation
- **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** are still in conflict, but the commands to climb have been executed successfully. We need to ensure that the vertical separation is maintained as they climb to their new altitudes.

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor the vertical separation** between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to ensure they are climbing to their new altitudes without further conflicts.

Let's check the current aircraft information to verify their altitudes and vertical speeds.

### Analysis
- **FLIGHT2** is climbing at 1500 fpm towards 19000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is climbing at 1500 fpm towards 20000 ft.
- The vertical separation between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 is increasing as both are climbing.

### Conclusion
The conflicts are being resolved as both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are climbing to their new altitudes, ensuring vertical separation is maintained. We should continue monitoring for a short duration to ensure no new conflicts arise.

Let's continue monitoring for another 8 seconds to confirm the resolution.

### Current Aircraft Information
- **FLIGHT1**
  - Altitude: 16600 ft
  - V/S: 0 fpm

- **FLIGHT2**
  - Altitude: 18151 ft
  - V/S: 1500 fpm (climbing)

- **FLIGHT3**
  - Altitude: 18907 ft
  - V/S: 1500 fpm (climbing)

### Analysis
- **FLIGHT2** is continuing to climb towards 19000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is continuing to climb towards 20000 ft.
- The vertical separation between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 is increasing as both are climbing.

### Conclusion
The conflicts are being resolved as both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are climbing to their new altitudes, ensuring vertical separation is maintained. The aircraft are on track to reach their assigned altitudes, and the vertical separation is increasing.

No further action is required at this moment. The conflicts will be resolved once the aircraft reach their assigned altitudes.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 25000'}`
responded: We have three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. Here are the details:

1. **FLIGHT1**:
   - Altitude: 22500 ft
   - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (stable)

2. **FLIGHT2**:
   - Altitude: 23370 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -135 fpm (descending)

3. **FLIGHT3**:
   - Altitude: 23367 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -164 fpm (descending)

### Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Distance: 6.86 NM
   - DCPA: 0.02 NM
   - tLOS: 209.10 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Distance: 6.54 NM
   - DCPA: 0.01 NM

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Distance: 6.86 NM
   - DCPA: 0.02 NM
   - tLOS: 209.10 sec

### Resolution Strategy:
To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 NM. Given the current vertical speeds, FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are descending and will soon violate the vertical separation requirement with FLIGHT1.

#### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT2**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, we will command FLIGHT2 to climb to a higher altitude.
2. **FLIGHT3**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we will command FLIGHT3 to climb to a higher altitude.

Let's issue the commands to FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to climb to 25000 ft.

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Distance 2.05 NM, TCPA 195.75 sec, tLOS 24.61 sec
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Distance 8.35 NM, TCPA 282.43 sec, tLOS 113.40 sec

### Conflict Resolution:
1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: FLIGHT2 is descending and will reach FLIGHT1's altitude soon.
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: FLIGHT3 is descending rapidly and will reach FLIGHT1's altitude soon.
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Both are descending, but FLIGHT3 is descending faster.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT2**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2 should stop descending and climb to a higher altitude.
- **FLIGHT3**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3 should stop descending and climb to a higher altitude.

Let's issue the commands to resolve these conflicts.

1. Command FLIGHT2 to climb to 17000 ft.
2. Command FLIGHT3 to climb to 18000 ft.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT3 19000'}`
responded: After monitoring for 8 seconds, the conflicts have been reduced, but there are still conflicts:

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Distance 5.94 NM, TCPA 307.05 sec, tLOS 48.69 sec

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3** is still descending and causing conflicts with both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.
- **FLIGHT2** is still in conflict with FLIGHT3, but the distance is increasing.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: We need to ensure FLIGHT3 climbs to a higher altitude to resolve the conflicts.

Let's issue another command to FLIGHT3 to climb to 19000 ft to ensure separation.

I'll send this command now.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG FLIGHT3 090'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 persists, though the distance is slowly increasing. FLIGHT3 is still descending, which is causing the conflict.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: Despite the command to climb to 19000 ft, the conflict persists. We need to ensure FLIGHT3 climbs more aggressively or changes heading to resolve the conflict.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: To ensure separation, we can change the heading of FLIGHT3 to avoid the conflict with FLIGHT2.

Let's issue a command to change FLIGHT3's heading to 090 degrees (East) to ensure horizontal separation.

I'll send this command now.

Number of aircraft in conflict: 2

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT3 20000'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 persists, although the distance is increasing and the closest point of approach (DCPA) is improving.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: Changing the heading has helped increase the DCPA, but the conflict still exists. We need to ensure FLIGHT3 climbs more aggressively to resolve the conflict.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: To ensure separation, we can command FLIGHT3 to climb to an even higher altitude, say 20000 ft.

I'll send this command now.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG FLIGHT3 120'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 persists, although the distance is improving. The DCPA is now 4.33 nautical miles, which is close to the required 5 nautical miles for horizontal separation.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: The climb to 20000 ft is helping, but we need to ensure that the horizontal separation is maintained.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: To ensure horizontal separation, we can change the heading further to ensure a safe distance.

Let's issue a command to change FLIGHT3's heading to 120 degrees (Southeast) to ensure horizontal separation.

I'll send this command now.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: The heading change is helping, but we need to ensure that the horizontal separation is maintained.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 28666'}`
responded: The conflict involves three aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. Here are the details:

- **FLIGHT1**: 
  - Altitude: 28000 ft
  - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)

- **FLIGHT2**: 
  - Altitude: 28666 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -391 fpm (descending)

- **FLIGHT3**: 
  - Altitude: 29367 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -766 fpm (descending)

### Conflict Analysis
1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**:
   - Current vertical separation: 666 ft
   - FLIGHT2 is descending at -391 fpm, which will reduce the separation further.

2. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**:
   - Current vertical separation: 701 ft
   - FLIGHT3 is descending at -766 fpm, which will reduce the separation further.

### Resolution Strategy
To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either a vertical separation of 2000 ft or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Given the current vertical speeds, we should adjust the altitudes to achieve vertical separation.

#### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Stop descending and level off at a safe altitude.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Stop descending and level off at a safe altitude.

Let's issue the commands to FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to level off at their current altitudes to prevent further descent and ensure separation.

#### Commands to send:
1. `ALT FLIGHT2 28666`
2. `ALT FLIGHT3 29367`

I'll send these commands now.

responded: All three aircraft (FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3) are at the same altitude of 21,600 feet with zero vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their current altitude. To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure vertical or horizontal separation. 

Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, we can resolve the conflict by changing the altitude of one or more aircraft to ensure the required vertical separation of 2000 feet.

Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT2 to 23,600 feet to create the necessary vertical separation.

responded: The conflict information shows that there are three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 28,000 ft with a vertical speed of 0 fpm. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**: Distance is 5.71 nautical miles.
2. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3**: Distance is 28.97 nautical miles.
3. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: Distance is 5.71 nautical miles.

To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Since the vertical speed is 0 fpm for all aircraft, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of one or more aircraft.

### Commands to Resolve Conflicts

1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain altitude at 28,000 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Change altitude to 30,000 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change altitude to 26,000 ft.

Let's send these commands to resolve the conflicts.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT3 30700'}`
responded: To resolve the remaining conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, I will adjust their altitudes further to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 feet.

Currently:
- FLIGHT1 is climbing to 28700 ft.
- FLIGHT3 is climbing to 28700 ft.

To ensure separation, I will adjust FLIGHT3 to a higher altitude.

Let's issue the command to FLIGHT3:

- FLIGHT3: Climb to 30700 ft

I will send this command now.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 persists despite the altitude adjustment. This indicates that the vertical separation is not sufficient or that the aircraft are still on a collision course horizontally.

To ensure complete separation, I will:
1. Verify the current altitudes and vertical speeds.
2. Adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to ensure horizontal separation as well.

Let's get the current aircraft information again and then decide on the heading adjustment.

### Conflict Analysis and Resolution

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Current Separation: 16.24 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.02 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 85.47 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 59.16 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Current Separation: 31.67 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.06 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 201.12 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 169.37 sec

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - Current Separation: 16.24 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.02 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 85.47 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 59.16 sec

### Resolution Commands

To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 NM. Given the current altitudes, we can adjust the altitudes to achieve vertical separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - FLIGHT1 is at 30,000 ft
   - FLIGHT2 is at 28,000 ft
   - To ensure vertical separation, we can adjust FLIGHT2 to 26,000 ft.

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - FLIGHT1 is at 30,000 ft
   - FLIGHT3 is at 32,000 ft
   - There is already sufficient vertical separation (2000 ft), no action needed.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - FLIGHT2 is at 28,000 ft
   - FLIGHT4 is at 26,000 ft
   - To ensure vertical separation, we can adjust FLIGHT2 to 30,000 ft.

We'll issue the following commands to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 26,000 ft
2. **FLIGHT2**: Climb to 30,000 ft after descending

Let's issue the commands sequentially to resolve the conflicts.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4 still persists. Given that the vertical separation commands are in progress, we should ensure that their headings are adjusted to provide immediate horizontal separation.

Let's issue the following heading commands to further separate them horizontally:

1. `HDG FLIGHT3 090` (East)
2. `HDG FLIGHT4 270` (West)

These commands should help in achieving the required horizontal separation while the aircraft climb to their new altitudes.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 14000'}`
responded: There are no conflicts detected at the moment. However, let's ensure that the aircraft maintain sufficient separation by examining their vertical speeds:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Altitude 20,000 ft, V/S 0 fpm (no change in altitude).
2. **FLIGHT2**: Altitude 16,019 ft, V/S -1500 fpm (descending).
3. **FLIGHT3**: Altitude 20,354 ft, V/S 1500 fpm (climbing).

Given the current vertical speeds:
- **FLIGHT2** is descending and may conflict with **FLIGHT1** if it continues to descend.
- **FLIGHT3** is climbing and may conflict with **FLIGHT1** if it continues to climb.

To prevent potential conflicts, we should adjust the altitudes of **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3**.

### Commands to Resolve Potential Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Ensure it does not descend into the altitude range of **FLIGHT1**.
   - Command: `ALT FLIGHT2 14000` (descend to 14,000 ft to ensure separation).

2. **FLIGHT3**: Ensure it does not climb into the altitude range of **FLIGHT1**.
   - Command: `ALT FLIGHT3 22000` (climb to 22,000 ft to ensure separation).

responded: The conflicts have been significantly reduced, but there are still some remaining. Let's further adjust the headings to ensure complete separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4**: They are still in conflict but the distance is increasing. Let's continue to monitor them.
2. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: The distance is increasing but still in conflict. Let's adjust FLIGHT2's heading further.

Let's change FLIGHT2's heading to 90 degrees to increase separation from FLIGHT3.

### Resolution Plan:
To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles between the conflicting aircraft. Since all aircraft are at the same altitude (27100 ft) and have a vertical speed of 0 fpm, we can resolve the conflicts by changing their altitudes.

1. **FLIGHT1:**
   - Command: `ALT FLIGHT1 29000`

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT1 13000'}`
responded: We have conflicts between the following aircraft pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 10,900 ft and have a vertical speed of 0 feet per minute, meaning they are maintaining their altitude.

To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical or horizontal separation. Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of some of the aircraft.

### Suggested Commands:
1. **FLIGHT1**: Change altitude to 13,000 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Change altitude to 9,000 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change altitude to 11,000 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Change altitude to 7,000 ft.

This will ensure vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft between each aircraft.

Let's send the commands:

1. `ALT FLIGHT1 13000`
2. `ALT FLIGHT2 9000`
3. `ALT FLIGHT3 11000`
4. `ALT FLIGHT4 7000`

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 17700'}`
responded: The conflict involves four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 15,700 ft with no vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their altitude. To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles between the aircraft pairs.

### Conflict Pairs:
1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**

### Resolution Strategy:
Since all aircraft are at the same altitude and have no vertical speed, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of some aircraft to achieve the required vertical separation.

#### Commands to Resolve Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain altitude (15,700 ft).
2. **FLIGHT2**: Change altitude to 17,700 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change altitude to 13,700 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Maintain altitude (15,700 ft).

This will ensure vertical separation of 2000 ft between the conflicting aircraft pairs.

Let's send the commands to change the altitudes of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT4 13700'}`
responded: After resolving some conflicts, there is still a conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4. Both aircraft are maintaining the same altitude of 15,700 ft.

### Resolution Strategy:
To resolve this conflict, we need to ensure vertical separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

#### Commands to Resolve Conflict:
1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain altitude (15,700 ft).
2. **FLIGHT4**: Change altitude to 13,700 ft.

This will ensure vertical separation of 2000 ft between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG FLIGHT4 261'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4 persists. This suggests that the vertical separation has not yet been achieved, possibly due to the time required for the altitude change to take effect.

### Resolution Strategy:
To ensure immediate separation, we can adjust the heading of FLIGHT4 to increase horizontal separation while the altitude change is in progress.

#### Commands to Resolve Conflict:
1. **FLIGHT4**: Change heading to 261 degrees (20 degrees left turn).
