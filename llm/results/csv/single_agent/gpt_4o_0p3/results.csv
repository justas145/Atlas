Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT CX520 22000'}`
responded: The aircraft CX520 and HV296 are both at an altitude of 20,000 feet and are on a collision course with a closest point of approach (DCPA) of 0.30 nautical miles. To resolve this conflict, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2,000 feet or horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles.

### Resolution Plan:
1. **Vertical Separation**: Change the altitude of one of the aircraft by 2,000 feet.

Since both aircraft are at the same altitude, we can change the altitude of one of them to achieve the required vertical separation.

Let's change the altitude of CX520 to 22,000 feet.

### Command:
- `ALT CX520 22000`

I will now send this command.
