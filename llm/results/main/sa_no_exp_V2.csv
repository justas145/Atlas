responded: All four aircraft (FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, FLIGHT4) are at the same altitude of 17,900 ft, which is causing a conflict. I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation. 

Let's assign the following altitudes:
- FLIGHT1: 17,900 ft (no change)
- FLIGHT2: 19,900 ft
- FLIGHT3: 15,900 ft
- FLIGHT4: 21,900 ft

This will ensure a vertical separation of 2,000 ft between each aircraft. I will now send the commands to resolve the conflicts.

- FLIGHT3 will descend to 32,200 ft.
- FLIGHT4 will descend to 30,200 ft.

responded: All four aircraft (FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, FLIGHT4) are at the same altitude of 34,200 ft and are in conflict with each other. To resolve this, I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

- FLIGHT1 will maintain its current altitude.
- FLIGHT2 will climb to 36,200 ft.
- FLIGHT3 will descend to 32,200 ft.
- FLIGHT4 will descend to 30,200 ft.

- I'll move FLIGHT1 to a higher altitude.
- I'll move FLIGHT2 to a lower altitude.
- I'll keep FLIGHT3 at the current altitude.
- I'll move FLIGHT4 to a higher altitude.

Let's proceed with these altitude changes.

responded: All four aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4, are at the same altitude of 31,700 feet and are in conflict due to insufficient vertical separation. I will resolve this by adjusting their altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 feet between each aircraft.

Let's proceed with the following altitude changes:
- FLIGHT1 will remain at 31,700 feet.
- FLIGHT2 will ascend to 33,700 feet.

responded: There are multiple conflicts involving all four aircraft. Here's the current situation:

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 1667.14 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 1703.07 ft.
3. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 818.26 ft.
4. **FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 854.19 ft.
5. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 848.88 ft.

To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between all aircraft. Here's the plan:

- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude.
- **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 13000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3**: Descend to 11000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4**: Maintain current altitude.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: There are three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is currently at 14,700 ft and is level. It can be instructed to climb to a higher altitude.
2. **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** are both descending and are at similar altitudes. We can instruct one of them to maintain their current altitude to avoid conflict with each other.

Let's implement the following changes:
- Instruct FLIGHT1 to climb to 17,000 ft.
- Instruct FLIGHT2 to maintain its current altitude at 15,200 ft.
- Allow FLIGHT3 to continue descending to 13,000 ft.

I'll send the commands now.

responded: We have multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation and close horizontal proximity. Here's the plan to resolve these conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 20,900 ft and level. It is in conflict with FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 21,703 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 21,701 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4** is descending and currently at approximately 21,683 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we will:
- Increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 to create vertical separation with the descending aircraft.
- Adjust the altitudes of FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4 to ensure they are separated by at least 2000 ft from each other and FLIGHT1.

responded: There are multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation and proximity in horizontal distance. Here's the plan to resolve these conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 23,200 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 24,029 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 24,866 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4** is descending and currently at approximately 24,041 ft.

### Resolution Plan:
- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude of 23,200 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 22,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current descending path to reach 26,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT4.
- **FLIGHT4**: Maintain current descending path to reach 24,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2.

responded: There are multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. Here's the situation:

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**: Vertical separation is decreasing and currently at 724.68 ft.
2. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is above the required minimum at 2252.13 ft, but horizontal distance is decreasing.
3. **FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing and currently at 771.87 ft.
4. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: Vertical separation is decreasing and currently at 755.57 ft.

responded: We have conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. Here's the current situation:

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**: They are too close both horizontally and vertically.
2. **FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4**: They are also too close both horizontally and vertically.
3. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3**: They have insufficient vertical separation.
4. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: They are too close both horizontally and vertically.

### Resolution Strategy

- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude.
- **FLIGHT2**: Descend further to increase vertical separation with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current descent rate.
- **FLIGHT4**: Maintain current descent rate.

Let's implement these changes:

responded: We have conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation. Here's the plan to resolve these conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 23,300 ft and level.
2. **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** are both descending and currently at around 24,137 ft and 24,136 ft respectively.
3. **FLIGHT4** is descending and currently at around 24,970 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, I'll adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

- **FLIGHT1** will remain at 23,300 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** will be instructed to descend to 22,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** will be instructed to descend to 20,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4** will be instructed to maintain its current altitude of 24,970 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: We have conflicts between the following aircraft pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**: Vertical separation is decreasing and will reach 0.0 NM.
2. **FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing and will reach 0.0 NM.
3. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: Vertical separation is decreasing and will reach 0.0 NM.

To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Here's the plan:

- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude.
- **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 28000 ft to increase vertical separation with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current descent to 30000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4**: Maintain current descent to 31000 ft.

Let's implement these changes.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 33000'}`
responded: There are multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 34,000 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and is currently at approximately 34,707 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and is currently at approximately 34,717 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4** is descending and is currently at approximately 35,440 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, I will adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

- Instruct **FLIGHT2** to descend to 33,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT3** to descend to 32,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT4** to maintain its current descent to 36,000 ft.

This will ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft between each aircraft. Let's issue these commands.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 15541'}`
responded: We have four aircraft in close proximity with potential conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Altitude 14,900 ft, heading 261°.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Altitude 15,541 ft, descending at -593 fpm.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Altitude 15,539 ft, descending at -399 fpm.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Altitude 15,539 ft, descending at -391 fpm.

All aircraft are on the same heading (261°) and FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4 are descending and are at similar altitudes, which could lead to a conflict.

### Conflict Resolution Plan:
- **FLIGHT1** is at a different altitude and not descending, so it is not in immediate conflict.
- **FLIGHT2**, **FLIGHT3**, and **FLIGHT4** are too close in altitude and descending, which can lead to a conflict. We need to separate them vertically.

### Commands to Resolve Conflict:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Maintain current altitude to avoid conflict with FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Descend to a lower altitude to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4.
3. **FLIGHT4**: Descend further to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT1 17000'}`
responded: There are multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 19,400 ft and is not in vertical motion. It can be moved to a lower altitude.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 20,120 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 20,842 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4** is descending and currently at approximately 20,865 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes as follows:
- **FLIGHT1**: Descend to 17,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Maintain current altitude at 20,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current altitude at 21,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4**: Ascend to 23,000 ft.

Let's execute these commands.

1. **FLIGHT1** is at 19,400 ft and is not in vertical motion. It can be moved to a lower altitude.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 20,120 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 20,842 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4** is descending and currently at approximately 20,865 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes as follows:
- **FLIGHT1**: Descend to 17,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Maintain current altitude at 20,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current altitude at 21,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4**: Ascend to 23,000 ft.

Let's execute these commands.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT1 18000'}`
responded: There are multiple conflicts involving four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation and some horizontal proximity. Here's the plan to resolve these conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Currently at 19,700 ft and level. It can be moved to a lower altitude to increase vertical separation with FLIGHT4.
2. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**: Both are descending and at similar altitudes. One of them should be moved to a different altitude to ensure vertical separation.
3. **FLIGHT4**: Descending from 21,207 ft. It can be moved to a higher altitude to increase separation from FLIGHT1.

Let's execute the following commands:

- **FLIGHT1**: Descend to 18,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Maintain current altitude at 20,385 ft.
- **FLIGHT3**: Descend further to 19,000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4**: Climb to 22,000 ft.

I'll send these commands now.

Both aircraft are at the same altitude of 26300 ft and are on different headings, which could lead to a conflict. To resolve this, I will change the altitude of one of the aircraft to ensure vertical separation. I will instruct FLIGHT1 to climb to 28300 ft.

responded: The conflict involves two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, with insufficient vertical separation. FLIGHT1 is at a level altitude of 13,500 ft, while FLIGHT2 is descending and currently at approximately 14,260 ft. To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft.

Let's adjust the altitudes:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain at 13,500 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 15,500 ft to ensure a 2,000 ft separation from FLIGHT1.

I will now send the command to adjust FLIGHT2's altitude.

responded: The conflict involves two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. FLIGHT1 is at a level altitude of 24,800 ft, while FLIGHT2 is descending and currently at approximately 25,307 ft. The vertical separation is insufficient, dropping from 600 ft to about 507 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft.

To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitudes to ensure proper vertical separation. I'll instruct FLIGHT1 to climb to 26,000 ft and FLIGHT2 to descend to 24,000 ft. This will provide a vertical separation of 2000 ft.

Let's proceed with these commands:

The vertical separation is decreasing and is currently at 469.31 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft separation.

To resolve this conflict, I'll adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

1. Instruct FLIGHT1 to climb to 12,000 ft.
2. Instruct FLIGHT2 to descend to 8,000 ft.

Let's execute these commands.

The vertical separation is currently 531.4 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft. The horizontal distance is 9.52 nautical miles, which is above the required 5 nautical miles, but the vertical separation is the main issue.

- FLIGHT2 is descending and currently at approximately 17,333 feet.

To resolve the conflict, I'll instruct FLIGHT2 to descend to a lower altitude, ensuring a vertical separation of at least 2000 feet. Let's set FLIGHT2 to 14,500 feet.

responded: The conflict involves two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. FLIGHT1 is at 11,800 ft and FLIGHT2 is descending and currently at approximately 12,587 ft. The vertical separation is decreasing and is currently about 787 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft vertical separation. The horizontal distance is sufficient, but the vertical separation needs to be addressed.

To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT2 to ensure a safe vertical separation. Let's increase FLIGHT2's altitude to 13,800 ft.

responded: The conflict involves two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. FLIGHT1 is at an altitude of 21,700 ft and level, while FLIGHT2 is descending and currently at 22,411 ft. The vertical separation is insufficient at 711 ft, and they are converging.

To resolve this conflict, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft. I will adjust the altitudes of the aircraft to achieve this separation. Let's proceed with the commands.

responded: All three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, are at the same altitude of 31,700 ft and are headed in the same direction (heading 006). This creates a conflict as they are not maintaining the required vertical or horizontal separation.

To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitudes of these aircraft to ensure vertical separation. Let's proceed with the following plan:
- FLIGHT1 will climb to 33,700 ft.
- FLIGHT2 will descend to 29,700 ft.
- FLIGHT3 will maintain its current altitude.

Let's execute these commands.

- FLIGHT1 will descend to 25,600 ft.
- FLIGHT2 will remain at 27,600 ft.

responded: All three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, are at the same altitude of 26,000 ft and are in conflict with each other. To resolve this conflict, I'll adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation.

Let's assign the following altitudes:
- FLIGHT1: 24,000 ft
- FLIGHT2: 26,000 ft (remain at current altitude)
- FLIGHT3: 28,000 ft

This will provide a vertical separation of 2,000 ft between each aircraft. I'll send the commands to adjust their altitudes accordingly.

FLIGHT1 is heading 310 degrees, while FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are both heading 130 degrees. This suggests a potential conflict due to the same altitude and converging paths.

To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitudes of the aircraft to ensure vertical separation. Let's proceed with the following changes:
- Increase FLIGHT1's altitude to 28,000 feet.
- Decrease FLIGHT2's altitude to 25,000 feet.
- Keep FLIGHT3 at the current altitude of 26,700 feet.

responded: All three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, are at the same altitude of 29,600 ft and are in conflict. To resolve this, I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation.

Let's proceed with the following altitude changes:
- FLIGHT1 will climb to 31,600 ft.
- FLIGHT2 will descend to 27,600 ft.
- FLIGHT3 will remain at 29,600 ft.

This will ensure a vertical separation of 2,000 ft between each aircraft.

responded: All three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, are at the same altitude of 29,600 ft and are in conflict. To resolve this, I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation.

Let's proceed with the following altitude changes:
- FLIGHT1 will climb to 31,600 ft.
- FLIGHT2 will descend to 27,600 ft.
- FLIGHT3 will remain at 29,600 ft.

This will ensure a vertical separation of 2,000 ft between each aircraft.

responded: All three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, are at the same altitude of 16,500 ft and are on the same heading of 358 degrees, which indicates a potential conflict. To resolve this, I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation. 

Let's proceed with the following altitude adjustments:
- FLIGHT1: Maintain current altitude.
- FLIGHT2: Climb to 17,500 ft.
- FLIGHT3: Descend to 14,500 ft.

I will now send these commands.

responded: We have three aircraft in close proximity, with FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 at the same altitude of 16,546 ft and descending, while FLIGHT1 is at 15,700 ft with no vertical speed. FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are on the same heading and track, indicating they are likely in conflict. Let's resolve this by adjusting their altitudes to ensure vertical separation. 

I'll issue commands to separate these aircraft vertically.

responded: Currently, there are three aircraft in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 (A320)**: 
   - Altitude: 16,400 ft
   - Heading: 026°
   - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm

2. **FLIGHT2 (B777)**: 
   - Altitude: 17,255 ft

3. **FLIGHT3 (A330)**: 
   - Altitude: 17,252 ft
   - Heading: 026°
   - Vertical Speed: -212 fpm

Both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are descending and are very close in altitude, which is causing a conflict. I will adjust the altitudes to resolve this conflict. 

- I will instruct FLIGHT2 to climb to 19,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT3.
- I will instruct FLIGHT3 to descend to 15,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.

Let's execute these commands.

2. Instruct FLIGHT3 to descend to 23400 ft.

To resolve these conflicts, I will adjust the altitudes of the aircraft to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft:

1. **FLIGHT1** will remain at 13200 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2** will be instructed to climb to 15200 ft.

responded: There are conflicts between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, as well as between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3. To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between each aircraft. Here's the plan:

1. **FLIGHT1** will remain at its current altitude of 23,500 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2** will be instructed to descend to 22,000 ft to increase vertical separation from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.
3. **FLIGHT3** will be instructed to descend further to 24,000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's execute these commands.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT1 34000'}`
responded: The conflicts involve three aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation, as all three aircraft are at altitudes that are too close to each other. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is currently at 30,400 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and is currently at approximately 31,228 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and is currently at approximately 32,063 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes as follows:

- Instruct **FLIGHT1** to climb to 34,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT2** to maintain its current altitude of 31,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT3** to descend further to 29,000 ft.

This will ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft between each aircraft. Let's execute these commands.

responded: The conflicts involve three aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation, as all three aircraft are at altitudes that are too close to each other. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is currently at 30,400 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and is currently at approximately 31,228 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and is currently at approximately 32,063 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes as follows:

- Instruct **FLIGHT1** to climb to 34,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT2** to maintain its current altitude of 31,000 ft.
- Instruct **FLIGHT3** to descend further to 29,000 ft.

This will ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft between each aircraft. Let's execute these commands.

responded: We have three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation. Here's the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1** is currently at 27,100 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 27,658 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 27,626 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between each aircraft:

- **FLIGHT1** will remain at 27,100 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** will be instructed to descend to 25,500 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** will be instructed to climb to 29,000 ft.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either a vertical separation of 2000 ft or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles between the aircraft. Here's the plan:

1. **FLIGHT1** is currently at 14,700 ft and is level.
2. **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 15,280 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 15,879 ft.

To achieve vertical separation:
- **FLIGHT1** will remain at 14,700 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** will be instructed to descend further to 13,700 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT1.
- **FLIGHT3** will be instructed to maintain its current altitude to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: We have three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. Currently, FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are descending and are at similar altitudes, causing a conflict. FLIGHT1 is at a lower altitude but is also in conflict with both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3. 

To resolve this, we can adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude at 27300 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Descend further to 26000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT3.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Ascend to 30000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: There are three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. The conflicts are primarily due to insufficient vertical separation as FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are descending.

To resolve the conflicts, I will adjust the altitudes to ensure a minimum vertical separation of 2000 feet between each aircraft:

1. **FLIGHT1** will remain at 28,000 feet.
2. **FLIGHT2** will descend to 26,000 feet.
3. **FLIGHT3** will descend to 30,000 feet.

Let's send these commands to resolve the conflicts.

responded: There are three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. They are currently at altitudes of 22,400 ft, 22,988.79 ft (descending), and 23,592.55 ft (descending), respectively. To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft between each pair.

### Proposed Solution:
- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude at 22,400 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Descend further to 20,400 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT1.
- **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current descent to 24,400 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's implement these changes.

The vertical separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 is 779.44 ft, and between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 is 795.5 ft, which is less than the required 2000 ft. To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitudes of the aircraft to ensure sufficient vertical separation.

- FLIGHT1 is currently at 16,600 ft.
- FLIGHT2 is descending and is currently at approximately 17,379 ft.
- FLIGHT3 is descending and is currently at approximately 18,175 ft.

I will adjust the altitudes as follows:
- Keep FLIGHT1 at 16,600 ft.
- Instruct FLIGHT2 to descend to 15,600 ft.
- Instruct FLIGHT3 to climb to 19,000 ft.

Let's execute these commands.

responded: The conflict between **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** has been resolved as they now have sufficient vertical separation. However, there is a new conflict between **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT3** due to insufficient horizontal separation.

To resolve this, we can adjust their headings to increase horizontal separation:

- **FLIGHT1** will be instructed to change heading to 190 degrees.
- **FLIGHT3** will be instructed to change heading to 220 degrees.

Let's send these commands.
