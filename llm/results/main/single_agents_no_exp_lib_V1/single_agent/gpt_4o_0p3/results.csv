Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 29300'}`
responded: Currently, there are no conflicts detected between the aircraft. However, let's review the aircraft information to ensure no potential conflicts might arise due to vertical speed changes.

### Aircraft Information:
1. **FLIGHT1**
   - Position: S55'28'50.0"" E059'22'9.0""
   - Heading: 194°
   - Altitude: 27300 ft
   - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)

2. **FLIGHT2**
   - Position: S56'00'11.0"" E058'49'56.0""
   - Heading: 044°
   - Altitude: 27937 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -600 fpm (descending)

### Analysis:
- FLIGHT1 is maintaining a level flight at 27300 ft.
- FLIGHT2 is descending at 600 fpm and currently at 27937 ft.

Given the current vertical speeds and altitudes:
- FLIGHT2 will reach FLIGHT1's altitude (27300 ft) in approximately \((27937 - 27300) / 600 \approx 1.06\) minutes.
- This descent might lead to a conflict if the horizontal separation is not maintained.

To ensure separation, we can command FLIGHT2 to level off at a higher altitude to maintain vertical separation.

### Command:
- **FLIGHT2**: Level off at 29300 ft to ensure a 2000 ft vertical separation from FLIGHT1.

Let's send the command to FLIGHT2.

Command executed successfully.
Invoking: `CONTINUEMONITORING` with `{'duration': 8}`
responded: The command to level off FLIGHT2 at 29300 ft has been executed successfully. This should ensure a vertical separation of 2000 ft from FLIGHT1, thus preventing any potential conflicts.

I will now monitor the situation for a short period to ensure no new conflicts arise.

No conflicts detected.

 After 8 seconds 
No conflicts detected.
The monitoring period has concluded, and no conflicts were detected. The airspace is currently conflict-free with the adjustments made.

responded: The conflict involves two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both are currently at the same altitude of 33,000 feet and have a horizontal separation of 7.61 nautical miles, which is less than the required 5 nautical miles. 

To resolve this conflict, I will change the altitude of one of the aircraft to ensure vertical separation.

Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT2 to 35,000 feet.

responded: Both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude of 31,400 feet with no vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their current altitude. To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 feet or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Given that the current horizontal distance is 25.69 nautical miles and the DCPA is 0.12 nautical miles, vertical separation is the most immediate solution.

Let's change the altitude of one of the aircraft to create the required vertical separation. I'll command FLIGHT1 to climb to 33,400 feet.

No conflicts detected.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 20800'}`
responded: Currently, there are no conflicts detected between the aircraft. However, we need to ensure that the vertical separation requirement is maintained, especially since FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are both descending and are at the same altitude.

### Aircraft Information:
- **FLIGHT1**: 
  - Altitude: 22,200 ft
  - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)
- **FLIGHT2**: 
  - Altitude: 22,800 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -507 fpm (descending)
- **FLIGHT3**: 
  - Altitude: 22,800 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -576 fpm (descending)

Since FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are both descending and at the same altitude, they will likely violate the vertical separation requirement soon. We need to change the altitude of one of these aircraft to ensure separation.

### Command to Resolve Potential Conflict:
We will instruct FLIGHT2 to descend to 20,800 ft to ensure a 2000 ft vertical separation from FLIGHT3.

Let's send the command to FLIGHT2:

   - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (stable)

2. **FLIGHT2**:
   - Altitude: 23370 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -135 fpm (descending)

3. **FLIGHT3**:
   - Altitude: 23367 ft
   - Vertical Speed: -164 fpm (descending)

### Conflicts:

### Resolution Strategy:
To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 NM. Given the current vertical speeds, FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are descending and will soon violate the vertical separation requirement with FLIGHT1.

#### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT2**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, we will command FLIGHT2 to climb to a higher altitude.
2. **FLIGHT3**: To avoid conflict with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we will command FLIGHT3 to climb to a higher altitude.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG FLIGHT3 090'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 persists, though the distance is slowly increasing. FLIGHT3 is still descending, which is causing the conflict.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: Despite the command to climb to 19000 ft, the conflict persists. We need to ensure FLIGHT3 climbs more aggressively or changes heading to resolve the conflict.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: To ensure separation, we can change the heading of FLIGHT3 to avoid the conflict with FLIGHT2.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT3 20000'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 persists, although the distance is increasing and the closest point of approach (DCPA) is improving.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: Changing the heading has helped increase the DCPA, but the conflict still exists. We need to ensure FLIGHT3 climbs more aggressively to resolve the conflict.

### Commands:
- **FLIGHT3**: To ensure separation, we can command FLIGHT3 to climb to an even higher altitude, say 20000 ft.

### Analysis:
- **FLIGHT3**: The climb to 20000 ft is helping, but we need to ensure that the horizontal separation is maintained.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 28666'}`
responded: The conflict involves three aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. Here are the details:

- **FLIGHT1**: 
  - Altitude: 28000 ft
  - Vertical Speed: 0 fpm (level flight)

- **FLIGHT2**: 
  - Altitude: 28666 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -391 fpm (descending)

- **FLIGHT3**: 
  - Altitude: 29367 ft
  - Vertical Speed: -766 fpm (descending)

### Conflict Analysis
1. **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2**:
   - Current vertical separation: 666 ft
   - FLIGHT2 is descending at -391 fpm, which will reduce the separation further.

2. **FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3**:
   - Current vertical separation: 701 ft
   - FLIGHT3 is descending at -766 fpm, which will reduce the separation further.

### Resolution Strategy
To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either a vertical separation of 2000 ft or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Given the current vertical speeds, we should adjust the altitudes to achieve vertical separation.

#### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Stop descending and level off at a safe altitude.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Stop descending and level off at a safe altitude.

Let's issue the commands to FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to level off at their current altitudes to prevent further descent and ensure separation.

responded: All three aircraft (FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3) are at the same altitude of 21,600 feet with zero vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their current altitude. To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure vertical or horizontal separation. 

Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, we can resolve the conflict by changing the altitude of one or more aircraft to ensure the required vertical separation of 2000 feet.

Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT2 to 23,600 feet to create the necessary vertical separation.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 persists despite the altitude adjustment. This indicates that the vertical separation is not sufficient or that the aircraft are still on a collision course horizontally.

To ensure complete separation, I will:
1. Verify the current altitudes and vertical speeds.
2. Adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to ensure horizontal separation as well.

Let's get the current aircraft information again and then decide on the heading adjustment.

responded: Given the current vertical speeds and altitudes, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 are both climbing and will eventually reach their assigned altitudes. However, to ensure horizontal separation, I will adjust the heading of FLIGHT3.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT3 to 110 degrees to ensure it diverges from FLIGHT1.

I will send the command now.

### Conflict Analysis and Resolution

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Current Separation: 16.24 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.02 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 85.47 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 59.16 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Current Separation: 31.67 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.06 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 201.12 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 169.37 sec

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - Current Separation: 16.24 NM
   - Closest Point of Approach (DCPA): 0.02 NM
   - Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA): 85.47 sec
   - Time of Loss of Separation (tLOS): 59.16 sec

### Resolution Commands

To resolve these conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 NM. Given the current altitudes, we can adjust the altitudes to achieve vertical separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - FLIGHT1 is at 30,000 ft
   - FLIGHT2 is at 28,000 ft
   - To ensure vertical separation, we can adjust FLIGHT2 to 26,000 ft.

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - FLIGHT1 is at 30,000 ft
   - FLIGHT3 is at 32,000 ft
   - There is already sufficient vertical separation (2000 ft), no action needed.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - FLIGHT2 is at 28,000 ft
   - FLIGHT4 is at 26,000 ft
   - To ensure vertical separation, we can adjust FLIGHT2 to 30,000 ft.

We'll issue the following commands to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 26,000 ft
2. **FLIGHT2**: Climb to 30,000 ft after descending

Let's issue the commands sequentially to resolve the conflicts.

### Conflict Resolution Plan:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2 Conflict:**
   - FLIGHT2 is descending at -466 fpm. To ensure vertical separation, we can command FLIGHT2 to maintain a higher altitude.

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3 Conflict:**
   - Both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 are at similar altitudes, but FLIGHT3 is descending. We can command FLIGHT3 to descend to a lower altitude.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3 Conflict:**
   - Both are descending. We can command FLIGHT3 to descend further to ensure separation.

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4 Conflict:**
   - FLIGHT4 is descending rapidly. We can command FLIGHT4 to maintain a higher altitude.

Let's issue the commands to resolve these conflicts.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 14000'}`
responded: There are no conflicts detected at the moment. However, let's ensure that the aircraft maintain sufficient separation by examining their vertical speeds:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Altitude 20,000 ft, V/S 0 fpm (no change in altitude).
2. **FLIGHT2**: Altitude 16,019 ft, V/S -1500 fpm (descending).
3. **FLIGHT3**: Altitude 20,354 ft, V/S 1500 fpm (climbing).

Given the current vertical speeds:
- **FLIGHT2** is descending and may conflict with **FLIGHT1** if it continues to descend.
- **FLIGHT3** is climbing and may conflict with **FLIGHT1** if it continues to climb.

To prevent potential conflicts, we should adjust the altitudes of **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3**.

### Commands to Resolve Potential Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Ensure it does not descend into the altitude range of **FLIGHT1**.
   - Command: `ALT FLIGHT2 14000` (descend to 14,000 ft to ensure separation).

2. **FLIGHT3**: Ensure it does not climb into the altitude range of **FLIGHT1**.
   - Command: `ALT FLIGHT3 22000` (climb to 22,000 ft to ensure separation).

Let's send these commands.

responded: We have conflicts between the following aircraft pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 10,900 ft and have a vertical speed of 0 feet per minute, meaning they are maintaining their altitude.

To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical or horizontal separation. Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of some of the aircraft.

### Suggested Commands:

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 9000'}`
responded: We have conflicts between the following aircraft pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 10,900 ft and have a vertical speed of 0 feet per minute, meaning they are maintaining their altitude.

To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical or horizontal separation. Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of some of the aircraft.

### Suggested Commands:
1. **FLIGHT1**: Change altitude to 13,000 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Change altitude to 9,000 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change altitude to 11,000 ft.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 17700'}`
responded: The conflict involves four aircraft: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4. All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 15,700 ft with no vertical speed, meaning they are maintaining their altitude. To resolve the conflicts, we need to ensure either vertical separation of 2000 ft or horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles between the aircraft pairs.

### Conflict Pairs:
1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**

### Resolution Strategy:
Since all aircraft are at the same altitude and have no vertical speed, we can resolve the conflicts by changing the altitude of some aircraft to achieve the required vertical separation.

#### Commands to Resolve Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain altitude (15,700 ft).
2. **FLIGHT2**: Change altitude to 17,700 ft.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change altitude to 13,700 ft.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Maintain altitude (15,700 ft).

This will ensure vertical separation of 2000 ft between the conflicting aircraft pairs.

Let's send the commands to change the altitudes of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG FLIGHT4 261'}`
responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4 persists. This suggests that the vertical separation has not yet been achieved, possibly due to the time required for the altitude change to take effect.

### Resolution Strategy:
To ensure immediate separation, we can adjust the heading of FLIGHT4 to increase horizontal separation while the altitude change is in progress.

#### Commands to Resolve Conflict:
1. **FLIGHT4**: Change heading to 261 degrees (20 degrees left turn).
