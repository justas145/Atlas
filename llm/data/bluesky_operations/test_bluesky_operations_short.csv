"Set wind conditions at 40.7128, -74.0060 for all altitudes with a direction of 270 degrees and speed of 15 knots.","WIND: wind
Define a wind vector (or a profile) at a specified position (and optionally at altitude). At one lat/lon position different wind vectors can be defined at different altitudes, will be interpolated with the inverse distance
Usage:
WIND lat,lon,alt/*,dir,spd,[alt,dir,spd,alt,...]

Arguments:

Name | Type      | Required | Description                     
-----+-----------+----------+---------------------------------
lat  | float     | Yes      | [[Latitude                      
lon  | float     | Yes      | [[Longitude                     
alt  | float/txt | Yes      | * means all altitudes[Altitude]]

Set the velocity threshold to 3 knots.,"CASMACHTHR: CASMachThr
Changes the threshold at which a velocity value is taken as a Mach number instead of CAS [kts].
Usage:
CASMACHTHR threshold

Arguments 1:

Name      | Type | Required | Description                                                                            
----------+------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
threshold | int  | yes      | The value under which a velocity value is taken as a Mach number instead of CAS in kts.


Example:

CASMACHTHR 3

Then, when a speed command is used, any value given below 3 is taken as a Mach number, any value above 3 is taken as kts.
Mach number:
SPD 2

Knots:
SPD 5

"Move aircraft A2 to coordinates 34.0522, -118.2437 at an altitude of 25000 feet, heading 270, speed 400 knots.","MOVE: Move
Instantaneously move an aircraft to a new position. If no values for the altitude, heading, speed and climb rate are provided, the aircraft will keep the old values.
Usage:
MOVE acid,lat,lon,[alt,hdg,spd,vspd]

Arguments:
