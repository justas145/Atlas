"Activate airborne separation assurance system. Then, enable conflict resolution. Set vertical navigation mode on for aircraft A1. When aircraft A1 reaches a specified distance from the given location, execute a command.","ASAS: Airborne Separation Assurance System
The Airborne Separation Assurance System (ASAS) is used to perform conflict detection and resolution between agents.
Usage:
ASAS ON/OFF

When ASAS is on, it is called every 'asas_dt' seconds. This value can be set in the settings.cfg file:
# ASAS update interval [sec]
asas_dt = 1.0

Conflict detection and resolution are called within the update of the traffic. The traffic update follows this order:
Note that the 'active' values are vectors with a dimension equal to the number of aircraft. In each position of the vector, 0 indicates that the aircraft with that index is not in conflict, 1 indicates that this aircraft is in conflict and its state should change to the value output by the conflict resolution module.
When ASAS is OFF, aircraft simply follow their trajectory as set by the AutoPilot class.
Conflict Detection:
By default, Bluesky uses a state-based conflict detection (statebased.py). The state-based method receives the current traffic information and performs the following calculations:
Other conflict detection modules may be added. This module should inherit from the ConflictDetection class (detection.py), and should overwrite function detect(). This new module can be called with the command:
CDMETHOD MODULE-NAME

Conflict Resolution:
Conflict resolution can be turned on and off through the following command:
RESO ON/OFF

By default, Bluesky uses the modified voltage potential (MVP) conflict resolution method. However, other conflict resolution methods can be added through plugins (see as reference ssd.py). A conflict resolution plugin must inherit from ConflictResolution.py and overwrite the resolve() function. This new conflict resolution method should be set by:
RESO MODULE-NAME

The plugin must also be activated in settings.cfg:
enabled_plugins = ['NAME']

Return to the route after conflict (Bouncing Conflicts)
Once an aircraft is no longer in conflict, and is past the closest point of approach with intruders, it must redirect itself to the next waypoint in its route. By default, the aircraft will follow the instructions from AutoPilot towards the next waypoint. Thus, it will follow a straight line toward its next waypoint. However, there is code in place to guarantee that aircraft do not keep bouncing on and off of conflicts when trying to move towards the next waypoint.
In resumenav(), in resolution.py, you can find:
The previous code finds whether two aircraft, previous in conflict with each other, will go back into conflict if they return directly to their next waypoint (bouncing conflict). An aircraft only returns to the next waypoint after there are no bouncing conflicts.

#####ATDIST: acid ATDIST pos dist command
When an aircraft reaches a given distance to the given position, execute the given command. Reaching the distance is detected by a sign change of the difference between current value and target value of the condition. So it works from within and from outside, but only once
The issued command can be any command for any a/c id. It could even be another ATDIST command which will only be active after reaching this distance (i.e. to something upon returning to the specified range circle).
Usage:

Provide a factor as argument to the function to zoom with a specific factor. A factor between 0.0 and 1.0 means zooming out, a factor larger than 1.0 indicates zooming in. Alternatively, use the words ""IN"" or ""OUT"" to zoom with a factor of 1.4 or 0.7.
Zoom can also be performed directly by pressing the + or - keys on the keyboard.
Usage:
ZOOM IN/OUT or factor

Arguments:

Name   | Type      | Required | Description            
-------+-----------+----------+------------------------
factor | txt/float | yes      | ""IN"" or ""OUT"" or factor

#####SWTOC: Switch on/off Top of Climb (ToC) guidance logic
Switch on or off the top of climb guidance logic (climb as early as allowed by altitude constraints in flight plan and as fast as allowed by performance)  As this logic is normally used by the FMS of an airliner it is ON by default, but can be switched ON or OFF with the SWTOC command. When switched off, the aircraft will start climbing  with a vertical speed aiming to arrive at the next altitude constraint further down the flight plan. (Intermediate waypoints without altitude constraints are irrelevant and not considered in the VNAV logic for altitude.)
Usage:
SWTOC acid,switch

Arguments:

Name   | Type   | Required | Description

Enable vertical navigation for the second aircraft.,"SWTOC: Switch on/off Top of Climb (ToC) guidance logic
Switch on or off the top of climb guidance logic (climb as early as allowed by altitude constraints in flight plan and as fast as allowed by performance)  As this logic is normally used by the FMS of an airliner it is ON by default, but can be switched ON or OFF with the SWTOC command. When switched off, the aircraft will start climbing  with a vertical speed aiming to arrive at the next altitude constraint further down the flight plan. (Intermediate waypoints without altitude constraints are irrelevant and not considered in the VNAV logic for altitude.)
Usage:

Set the time to 14:30:00. Turn on the airborne separation assurance system. Set the speed of aircraft A1 to 450 knots. Turn off top of descent guidance for aircraft A2.,"ASAS: Airborne Separation Assurance System
The Airborne Separation Assurance System (ASAS) is used to perform conflict detection and resolution between agents.
Usage:
ASAS ON/OFF

When ASAS is on, it is called every 'asas_dt' seconds. This value can be set in the settings.cfg file:
# ASAS update interval [sec]
asas_dt = 1.0

Conflict detection and resolution are called within the update of the traffic. The traffic update follows this order:
Note that the 'active' values are vectors with a dimension equal to the number of aircraft. In each position of the vector, 0 indicates that the aircraft with that index is not in conflict, 1 indicates that this aircraft is in conflict and its state should change to the value output by the conflict resolution module.
When ASAS is OFF, aircraft simply follow their trajectory as set by the AutoPilot class.
Conflict Detection:
By default, Bluesky uses a state-based conflict detection (statebased.py). The state-based method receives the current traffic information and performs the following calculations:
Other conflict detection modules may be added. This module should inherit from the ConflictDetection class (detection.py), and should overwrite function detect(). This new module can be called with the command:
CDMETHOD MODULE-NAME

Conflict Resolution:
Conflict resolution can be turned on and off through the following command:
RESO ON/OFF

By default, Bluesky uses the modified voltage potential (MVP) conflict resolution method. However, other conflict resolution methods can be added through plugins (see as reference ssd.py). A conflict resolution plugin must inherit from ConflictResolution.py and overwrite the resolve() function. This new conflict resolution method should be set by:
RESO MODULE-NAME

The plugin must also be activated in settings.cfg:
enabled_plugins = ['NAME']

Return to the route after conflict (Bouncing Conflicts)
Once an aircraft is no longer in conflict, and is past the closest point of approach with intruders, it must redirect itself to the next waypoint in its route. By default, the aircraft will follow the instructions from AutoPilot towards the next waypoint. Thus, it will follow a straight line toward its next waypoint. However, there is code in place to guarantee that aircraft do not keep bouncing on and off of conflicts when trying to move towards the next waypoint.
In resumenav(), in resolution.py, you can find:
The previous code finds whether two aircraft, previous in conflict with each other, will go back into conflict if they return directly to their next waypoint (bouncing conflict). An aircraft only returns to the next waypoint after there are no bouncing conflicts.

#####ASAS: Airborne Separation Assurance System
The Airborne Separation Assurance System (ASAS) is used to perform conflict detection and resolution between agents.
Usage:

When ASAS is on, it is called every 'asas_dt' seconds. This value can be set in the settings.cfg file:
# ASAS update interval [sec]
asas_dt = 1.0

Conflict detection and resolution are called within the update of the traffic. The traffic update follows this order:
Note that the 'active' values are vectors with a dimension equal to the number of aircraft. In each position of the vector, 0 indicates that the aircraft with that index is not in conflict, 1 indicates that this aircraft is in conflict and its state should change to the value output by the conflict resolution module.
When ASAS is OFF, aircraft simply follow their trajectory as set by the AutoPilot class.
Conflict Detection:
By default, Bluesky uses a state-based conflict detection (statebased.py). The state-based method receives the current traffic information and performs the following calculations:
Other conflict detection modules may be added. This module should inherit from the ConflictDetection class (detection.py), and should overwrite function detect(). This new module can be called with the command:
CDMETHOD MODULE-NAME

Conflict Resolution:
Conflict resolution can be turned on and off through the following command:
RESO ON/OFF

By default, Bluesky uses the modified voltage potential (MVP) conflict resolution method. However, other conflict resolution methods can be added through plugins (see as reference ssd.py). A conflict resolution plugin must inherit from ConflictResolution.py and overwrite the resolve() function. This new conflict resolution method should be set by:
RESO MODULE-NAME

The plugin must also be activated in settings.cfg:
enabled_plugins = ['NAME']

Return to the route after conflict (Bouncing Conflicts)
Once an aircraft is no longer in conflict, and is past the closest point of approach with intruders, it must redirect itself to the next waypoint in its route. By default, the aircraft will follow the instructions from AutoPilot towards the next waypoint. Thus, it will follow a straight line toward its next waypoint. However, there is code in place to guarantee that aircraft do not keep bouncing on and off of conflicts when trying to move towards the next waypoint.
In resumenav(), in resolution.py, you can find:
The previous code finds whether two aircraft, previous in conflict with each other, will go back into conflict if they return directly to their next waypoint (bouncing conflict). An aircraft only returns to the next waypoint after there are no bouncing conflicts.

KL204 AT LOPIK SPD 250  =>at this waypoint will set the speed to 250 kts
KL204 AT LOPIK FL100/250 => does both the above in one go
KL204 AT LOPIK DO ECHO HELLO WORLD => ""ECHO HELLO WORLD"" will be issued when this waypoint is passed by KL204
KL204 AT LOPIK DO HDG 270 => will issue ""KL204 HDG 270:"" when KL204 passes this waypoint 
KL204 AT LOPIK DO KLM1705 DIRECT SPY => will issue ""KLM1705 DIRECT SPY"" when KL204 passes this waypoint (offers lots of interactions!) 
KL204 AT LOPIK STACK ECHO HELLO WORLD => ""ECHO HELLO WORLD"" will be issued when this waypoint is passed by KL204 (so same as first)
KL204 AT LOPIK  => shows everything entered at this waypoint\

#####ATDIST: acid ATDIST pos dist command
When an aircraft reaches a given distance to the given position, execute the given command. Reaching the distance is detected by a sign change of the difference between current value and target value of the condition. So it works from within and from outside, but only once
The issued command can be any command for any a/c id. It could even be another ATDIST command which will only be active after reaching this distance (i.e. to something upon returning to the specified range circle).
Usage:
acid ATDIST pos, dist, cmdtxt

Arguments:

Name   | Type   | Required | Description

cmdtxt | string | Yes      | Full command line to be issued when condition is met

#####DEL: Del
The DEL command is used to delete objects while running Bluesky. The function needs one argument, which can be three different kinds of references:
acid
If the argument is equal to an aircraft callsign, the aircraft is removed from the simulation.
WIND
If the argument is the text ""WIND"", then wind is removed from the simulation.
shape
If the argument is the name of one of the area shapes defined, then the area is removed from the simulation.
Usage:
DEL acid/WIND/shape

Arguments:

Name   | Type | Required | Description  
-------+------+----------+--------------
object | txt  | yes      | [[Object name

#####SWTOC: Switch on/off Top of Climb (ToC) guidance logic
Switch on or off the top of climb guidance logic (climb as early as allowed by altitude constraints in flight plan and as fast as allowed by performance)  As this logic is normally used by the FMS of an airliner it is ON by default, but can be switched ON or OFF with the SWTOC command. When switched off, the aircraft will start climbing  with a vertical speed aiming to arrive at the next altitude constraint further down the flight plan. (Intermediate waypoints without altitude constraints are irrelevant and not considered in the VNAV logic for altitude.)
Usage:
SWTOC acid,switch

Arguments:

Name   | Type   | Required | Description

Examples:
Print the current mode of the ADDWPT command in the console:
ADDWPTMODE acid

Changing the ADDWPT mode to TURNSPD:
ADDWPTMODE acid TURNSPD

Setting the turn speed for the next ADDWPT commands:
ADDWPT acid TURNSPD 15
