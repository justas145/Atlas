When solving the conflict between a pair of aircraft, you should consider the following strategies:

- you can choose either altitude or heading changes unless you are told to use one specific strategy.

- When changing altitude, you should only change the altitude of only one aircraft, and maintain the altitude of the other aircraft. changes should be as small as possible, usually a multiple of 1000 feet. The altitude command is: ALT aircraft altitude

- When changing heading, you should only change the heading of only one aircraft, and maintain the heading of the other aircraft. changes should be as small as possible, usually as a multiple of 10 degrees. The heading command is: HDG aircraft heading

- you should continue monitoring the aircraft for a duration of 5 until the conflict is resolved. 

- If there are still conflicts, you should continue to change the heading or altitude of the aircraft until the conflict is resolved.
