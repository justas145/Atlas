**Conflict Details**:
- Vertical Separation: 635.62 ft (after monitoring)
- Horizontal Separation: 14.34 Nautical miles
- Time to Lose Separation (tLOS): 163.18 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft. Currently, the separation is only 635.62 ft.

### Resolution Plan:
- **FLIGHT2** is descending. We can instruct it to descend further to increase the vertical separation.

Let's command FLIGHT2 to descend to 15,000 ft to ensure a safe vertical separation.

responded: We have one conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. The vertical separation is currently 761.09 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft. We can resolve this conflict by adjusting the altitude of one of the aircraft.

### Current Aircraft Information:
- **FLIGHT1**:

### Conflict Details:
- Vertical Separation: 761.09 ft
- Required Vertical Separation: 2000 ft

### Resolution Plan:
To resolve the conflict, we can increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 to ensure a minimum vertical separation of 2000 ft. 

Let's calculate the new altitude for FLIGHT2:
- Current altitude of FLIGHT1: 13,500 ft
- Required separation: 2000 ft
- New altitude for FLIGHT2: 13,500 ft + 2000 ft = 15,500 ft

Let's send the command to change FLIGHT2's altitude to 15,500 ft.

**Conflict Details**:
- Vertical Separation: 671.18 ft (needs to be at least 2000 ft)
- Horizontal Separation: 18.08 nautical miles (sufficient)
- tLOS: 73.11 seconds

To resolve this conflict, we need to increase the vertical separation. Since FLIGHT2 is descending, we can either stop its descent or have FLIGHT1 climb. Let's have FLIGHT1 climb to 27,500 ft to ensure vertical separation. 

I'll send the command to FLIGHT1 to climb to 27,500 ft.

Since we are allowed to only change the aircraft altitude, I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT1 to resolve the conflict by increasing its altitude to ensure a minimum vertical separation of 2000 ft. 

Let's calculate the new altitude for FLIGHT1. To achieve a vertical separation of 2000 ft, FLIGHT1 should be at least 2000 ft above or below FLIGHT2. Since FLIGHT2 is descending, we can increase FLIGHT1's altitude.

**New Altitude for FLIGHT1**: 24,643 ft + 2000 ft = 26,643 ft

responded: We have a conflict between two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both are currently at the same altitude of 27,400 ft with no vertical separation. The time to lose separation (tLOS) is decreasing, indicating the need for immediate action.

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, I will adjust the altitude of one of the aircraft to resolve the conflict. Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT2 to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft.

### Action Plan:
- Change the altitude of FLIGHT2 from 27,400 ft to 29,400 ft to achieve the required vertical separation.

Let's send the command to change FLIGHT2's altitude.

responded: We have a conflict between two aircraft, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both are currently at the same altitude of 34,500 feet, and there is no vertical separation between them. The conflict is due to their proximity, with a time to lose separation (tLOS) of 186.21 seconds.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's resolve this conflict by adjusting the altitude of one of the aircraft to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 feet.

Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT2 to 36,500 feet.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**:
   - Vertical Separation: 730.23 ft
   - tLOS: 224.37 sec

Since we are only allowed to change altitude, let's resolve the conflicts by adjusting the altitudes of the aircraft:

- **FLIGHT1** is currently at 23,700 ft and level.
- **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 24,430 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 25,179 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitude of FLIGHT1 to ensure vertical separation with both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3. Let's increase FLIGHT1's altitude to 26,000 ft to achieve the required separation.

I'll send the command to change FLIGHT1's altitude.

To resolve these conflicts, we need to adjust the altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft. Let's start by addressing the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, which has the shortest tLOS.

### Proposed Actions:
- **FLIGHT1** is currently at 27300 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at 28025.39 ft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, let's adjust FLIGHT1's altitude to 25300 ft, ensuring a vertical separation greater than 2000 ft from FLIGHT3.

Let's send the command to change FLIGHT1's altitude.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's resolve these conflicts by adjusting the altitudes to meet the separation requirements.

### Proposed Actions:
- **FLIGHT1** is currently at 15,700 ft and is level.
- **FLIGHT2** is descending and currently at approximately 16,503 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is descending and currently at approximately 16,500 ft.

To resolve the conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, which are descending, to ensure vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft from FLIGHT1.

1. **Increase FLIGHT1's altitude** to 17,700 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

- **FLIGHT2** is descending. We can adjust its altitude to create the required separation from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT3** is also descending, so we can adjust its altitude to ensure separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's start by increasing FLIGHT2's altitude to 16000 ft to separate it from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.

### Conflict Details:
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
  - TCPA: 917.57 seconds
  - Heading Difference: 0.0 degrees

  - Vertical Separation: 13.2 ft
  - Horizontal Distance: 13.07 Nautical miles
  - DCPA: 0.07 Nautical miles
  - tLOS: 566.98 seconds

### Resolution Strategy:
Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, we need to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3. Both aircraft are descending and are at the same altitude. I will instruct FLIGHT3 to descend further to create the necessary separation.

Let's send the command to FLIGHT3 to descend to 20,800 ft.

Command executed successfully.

   - tLOS: 209.42 sec

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Vertical Separation: 556.94 ft
   - tLOS: 209.42 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, let's address the conflicts by adjusting the altitudes to achieve the required vertical separation of 2000 ft.

### Conflict Resolution Plan:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT2.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 by adjusting FLIGHT1's altitude.

   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 45.56 Nautical miles
   - Time to Lose Separation (tLOS): 229.68 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, I will adjust the altitude of one aircraft in each conflict pair to ensure vertical separation of at least 2000 ft.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 by changing the altitude of FLIGHT3.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT3 33700'}`
responded: We have three aircraft, FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3, all flying at the same altitude of 31,700 feet. There are three conflict pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 0.96 Nautical miles

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 6.54 Nautical miles

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 5.59 Nautical miles

To resolve these conflicts, we need to change the altitude of at least one aircraft in each conflicting pair to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 feet.

### Resolution Steps:

- **FLIGHT3** can be instructed to climb to 33,700 feet to resolve the conflict with both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.

Let's send the command to change FLIGHT3's altitude.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**:
   - TCPA: 126.49 sec
   - tLOS: 92.1 sec

Since all aircraft are at the same altitude, I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT3 to resolve the conflicts. Let's change FLIGHT3's altitude to 28,000 feet to ensure vertical separation.

To resolve these conflicts, we need to adjust the altitudes to achieve at least 2000 ft of vertical separation. Let's start with the pair with the shortest tLOS, **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4** and **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**.

### Actions:
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 to 15000 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT4.
- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2**: Decrease the altitude of FLIGHT1 to 11000 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT2.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 816.67 ft
   - tLOS: 158.24 sec

2. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 819.24 ft
   - tLOS: 87.17 sec

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Vertical Separation: 815.93 ft
   - tLOS: 87.17 sec

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 1635.91 ft
   - tLOS: 145.46 sec

To resolve these conflicts, we need to adjust the altitudes to achieve at least 2000 ft of vertical separation. Let's start with the pair with the shortest tLOS, **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4** and **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**.

### Actions:
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 to 15000 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT4.
- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2**: Decrease the altitude of FLIGHT1 to 11000 ft to ensure separation from FLIGHT2.

Let's send these commands.

responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 741.4 ft
   - tLOS: 84.31 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 1398.89 ft
   - tLOS: 72.05 sec

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 718.46 ft
   - tLOS: 47.77 sec

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Vertical Separation: 680.42 ft
   - tLOS: 47.77 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's address the conflicts starting with the pair having the shortest tLOS.

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:

- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT2 to achieve at least 2000 ft vertical separation.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT3 to achieve at least 2000 ft vertical separation.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. We will increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 to 23000 ft to ensure separation.

responded: The conflict between **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2** has been resolved. However, we still have conflicts between:

1. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 577.35 ft
   - tLOS: 47.63 sec

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 523.29 ft
   - tLOS: 47.63 sec

### Next Steps:

- **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT4 to achieve at least 2000 ft vertical separation.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Since FLIGHT3 is descending, we can continue to lower its altitude further to resolve the conflict.

Let's decrease the altitude of FLIGHT3 to 20000 ft to resolve both conflicts.

responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: 
   - TCPA: 150.62 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 717.54 ft
   - tLOS: 121.81 sec

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - TCPA: 62.96 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 660.66 ft
   - tLOS: 39.04 sec

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - TCPA: 62.96 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 625.74 ft
   - tLOS: 39.04 sec

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: 
   - TCPA: 120.71 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 2003.94 ft (already meets separation requirements)

To resolve these conflicts, we will focus on changing the altitudes of the aircraft to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft. Let's start by addressing the conflicts with the shortest tLOS.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Since FLIGHT2 is descending, we can adjust FLIGHT3's altitude to ensure separation.

Let's change the altitude of FLIGHT3 to a higher altitude to resolve the conflicts with FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT1. We'll set FLIGHT3 to climb to 29000 ft.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 33000'}`
responded: We have multiple aircraft pairs in conflict, and the operator's preference is to resolve conflicts by changing altitudes only. Here is the current conflict information:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 731.46 ft.
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 1437.72 ft.
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 716.44 ft.
4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 721.28 ft.
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Vertical separation is decreasing, currently at 706.26 ft.

Let's resolve these conflicts by adjusting the altitudes to ensure a minimum vertical separation of 2000 ft. 

### Proposed Actions:

- **FLIGHT2** is descending, so we can instruct it to descend further to 33000 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is also descending, so we can instruct it to descend further to 32000 ft.
- **FLIGHT4** is descending, so we can instruct it to descend further to 36000 ft.

Let's send these commands to resolve the conflicts.

responded: We have the following aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 38.62 ft
   - tLOS: 91.51 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 557.56 ft
   - tLOS: 232.0 sec

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Vertical Separation: 555.77 ft
   - tLOS: 75.79 sec

4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 1.79 ft
   - tLOS: -318.28 sec

5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Vertical Separation: 517.15 ft
   - tLOS: 91.51 sec

Since we are only allowed to change altitudes, let's focus on resolving the conflicts with the smallest vertical separation first. The most critical conflicts are between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4, as they have the least vertical separation.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** are descending, so we can adjust their altitudes to ensure separation.
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4** have almost no vertical separation, so we need to increase separation here as well.

Let's start by increasing the altitude of FLIGHT2 to create separation from FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4. We'll move FLIGHT2 to a higher altitude to ensure a minimum of 2000 ft separation.

### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT2**: Climb to 17500 ft (to ensure separation from FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4).

Let's send the command to FLIGHT2.

   - tLOS: 200.72 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**

   - tLOS: 37.91 sec

3. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - Vertical Separation: 6.75 ft
   - tLOS: 37.91 sec

### Next Steps:
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4** are descending, so we can further adjust their altitudes to ensure separation.
- Since FLIGHT2 is climbing, it should soon be clear of conflicts.

Let's increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 to ensure separation from FLIGHT4 and FLIGHT1.

### Commands:
1. **FLIGHT3**: Climb to 17000 ft (to ensure separation from FLIGHT4 and FLIGHT1).

   - Vertical Separation: 1000.93 ft
   - tLOS: 0.77 sec

### Resolution:
- **FLIGHT3** is ascending and should soon be clear of conflicts as it reaches its new altitude of 17000 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** is already at 17500 ft, providing sufficient separation once FLIGHT3 stabilizes.

Let's wait a little longer to ensure FLIGHT3 reaches its new altitude and resolves the conflict. I'll monitor the situation for a short duration to confirm the resolution.

### Resolution:
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: This conflict is no longer imminent, so we can consider it resolved for now.
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: Both aircraft are at the same altitude, so we need to adjust one of them to ensure vertical separation.

Given the tLOS, we should prioritize resolving the conflict between **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3** first, as it has the shortest time to lose separation. 

Let's adjust the altitude of FLIGHT1 to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft from FLIGHT3. 

Current Altitudes:

- **FLIGHT2** is descending. We can instruct it to descend further to increase separation.
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4** are also descending. We can adjust their altitudes accordingly.

Let's start by resolving the conflicts with the lowest vertical separation first. We'll adjust FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to ensure they have at least 2000 ft separation.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**:
   - Current vertical separation: 560.09 ft
   - Required vertical separation: 2000 ft
   - tLOS: 63.21 seconds

Since we can only change altitudes, let's resolve the conflict with the shortest tLOS first, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3. 

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT1** is at 20800 ft and level.
- **FLIGHT3** is descending from 22005.94 ft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, we can increase FLIGHT1's altitude to ensure a 2000 ft separation. Let's change FLIGHT1's altitude to 2000 ft above FLIGHT3's current altitude.

**Command**: Increase FLIGHT1's altitude to 24005.94 ft.

   - Current vertical separation: 497.29 ft
   - Required vertical separation: 2000 ft

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**:
   - Current vertical separation: 4.44 ft
   - Required vertical separation: 2000 ft

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**:
   - Current vertical separation: 501.73 ft
   - Required vertical separation: 2000 ft

To resolve these conflicts, we can adjust the altitudes of the aircraft. Let's start by increasing the altitude of FLIGHT3 to ensure it maintains a safe vertical separation from both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT1. 

I'll send the command to change the altitude of FLIGHT3.

   - tLOS: 193.53 sec

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**

   - tLOS: 122.24 sec

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Vertical Separation: 730.09 ft
   - tLOS: 122.24 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's address these conflicts by adjusting the altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT3** and **FLIGHT4**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT4.
- **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2**: Increase the altitude of FLIGHT1 or decrease the altitude of FLIGHT2.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, as it has the earliest tLOS. We will increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 to 33000 ft.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
5. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
6. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**

Given the operator's preference to only use altitude changes, let's resolve these conflicts by adjusting the altitudes of the aircraft involved.

### Plan:
- We will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 to create vertical separation.
- Increase FLIGHT2's altitude by 2,000 ft to 30,600 ft.
- Decrease FLIGHT3's altitude by 2,000 ft to 26,600 ft.

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 76.14 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 76.14 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, let's resolve the conflicts by adjusting the altitudes of the aircraft with the smallest tLOS first. 

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Increase FLIGHT3's altitude by 2000 ft to 25,800 ft.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: Increase FLIGHT4's altitude by 2000 ft to 25,800 ft.

Let's start by sending the commands to resolve these conflicts.

Since we are only allowed to change altitudes, let's resolve the conflicts by adjusting the altitudes of the aircraft. I'll start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, as it has the shortest time to lose separation.

I'll change the altitude of FLIGHT3 to 35,400 feet to ensure vertical separation.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT4 36200'}`
responded: We have five aircraft pairs in conflict, and all aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 34,200 ft. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 103.14 seconds
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = -189.06 seconds (already lost separation)
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 242.78 seconds
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 138.17 seconds
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 138.17 seconds

Since we are allowed to only change the aircraft altitude, let's resolve these conflicts by adjusting the altitude of some aircraft to ensure vertical separation.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT4** are in conflict with multiple aircraft. We can adjust the altitude of one of these aircraft.
- Change the altitude of **FLIGHT4** to 36,200 ft to resolve conflicts with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.

Let's send the command to change the altitude of FLIGHT4.

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Already lost separation

### Next Steps:
- **FLIGHT1** is still ascending. Let's allow it to reach its new altitude and then reassess the conflicts.
- Once FLIGHT1 reaches 36,200 ft, we should have vertical separation among all aircraft.

Let's wait for FLIGHT1 to reach its new altitude and monitor the airspace again.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT4 21100'}`
responded: We have the following aircraft pairs in conflict, all at the same altitude of 19,100 ft:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 78.82 sec
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 52.44 sec
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 192.71 sec
4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 96.61 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 78.82 sec

Since we can only change altitude, let's resolve the conflicts starting with the pair with the shortest tLOS. 

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: This pair has the shortest tLOS of 52.44 seconds. We can change the altitude of either FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT4 to resolve this conflict.

Let's start by changing the altitude of FLIGHT4 to 21,100 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT1.

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 44.15 sec
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 1684.98 sec
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 221.53 sec
4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 162.0 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 44.15 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, let's resolve the conflicts starting with the pair having the shortest tLOS.

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:
- Increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4 to create vertical separation for the pair with the shortest tLOS.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4. We'll adjust FLIGHT2's altitude first.

5. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = -356.65 sec (already lost separation)
6. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 139.25 sec

Given the operator's preference to only change altitudes, let's address the conflict with the shortest tLOS first, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

I will change the altitude of FLIGHT4 to resolve this conflict. Let's increase FLIGHT4's altitude by 2000 ft to ensure separation.

responded: We have multiple aircraft pairs in conflict, all flying at the same altitude of 26,900 feet. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 137.3 seconds
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = -370.89 seconds
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = -145.89 seconds

5. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 255.85 seconds
6. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 137.3 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, I will begin by resolving the conflicts with the shortest tLOS. I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT3 to create vertical separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT1. Let's raise FLIGHT3 by 2000 feet to 28,900 feet.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, as well as FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, has been resolved as FLIGHT3 ascends. However, there are still conflicts involving FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4, FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4, and FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.

Since FLIGHT3 is still ascending, let's wait a bit longer for it to reach its new altitude and then check for conflicts again. I will continue monitoring for a short duration.

Since we are only allowed to change the altitude, I will resolve the conflicts by adjusting the altitudes of the aircraft. Let's start with the pair with the shortest tLOS, which is FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4 and FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2. I will change the altitude of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4 to ensure vertical separation. 

Let's increase the altitude of FLIGHT2 by 2000 ft to 29,100 ft and decrease the altitude of FLIGHT4 by 2000 ft to 25,100 ft.

responded: The commands to change the altitudes of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4 have successfully resolved most of the conflicts. Now, only one conflict remains:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Time to lose separation (tLOS): 81.18 seconds
   - Vertical separation: 0 ft

To resolve this conflict, I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT3. Let's increase the altitude of FLIGHT3 by 2000 ft to 29,100 ft.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - tLOS: 71.05 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 12.0 nautical miles

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 10,900 ft. To resolve these conflicts using altitude changes, I will adjust the altitudes of the involved aircraft to ensure vertical separation.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT2**: Increase altitude to 13,000 ft to resolve conflicts with FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

Let's send the command to change FLIGHT2's altitude.

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS is 228.69 seconds.
4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS is 196.18 seconds.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's resolve the conflict with the shortest tLOS first, which is between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4. 

I will change the altitude of FLIGHT4 to ensure vertical separation. Let's change FLIGHT4's altitude to 35,100 ft.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT4 17700'}`
responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict, and all aircraft are at the same altitude of 15,700 feet with no vertical separation. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - tLOS: 226.67 seconds

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 69.01 seconds

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - tLOS: 69.01 seconds

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - tLOS: 52.03 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft altitude, let's resolve the conflicts starting with the pair with the shortest tLOS, FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4.

To resolve the conflict, I'll adjust the altitude of FLIGHT4. Let's increase its altitude by 2000 feet to ensure vertical separation.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT2 17700'}`
responded: The conflict between **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4** has been resolved as FLIGHT4 is ascending to 17,700 feet. However, we still have two conflicts remaining:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 32.97 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - tLOS: 32.97 seconds

Let's resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by adjusting the altitude of FLIGHT2. I'll increase its altitude by 2000 feet to ensure vertical separation.
