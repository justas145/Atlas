responded: We have a conflict between two aircraft: FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both are at the same altitude of 33,000 ft with no vertical separation, and they are on a collision course with a heading difference of 15 degrees. The time to lose separation (tLOS) is 56.16 seconds.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's adjust the heading of one of the aircraft to resolve this conflict. I'll change the heading of FLIGHT1 to increase the separation. 

Let's change FLIGHT1's heading to 040 degrees to increase the separation angle.

   - Heading Difference: 153.0 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 744.62 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 11.37 Nautical miles

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**:
   - TCPA: 288.98 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 46.0 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 749.19 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 21.27 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 221.06 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the heading, let's address the conflicts by adjusting the headings of the aircraft. Given the heading differences, we can try to increase the separation by altering the headings of FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, as their tLOS is the shortest.

Let's start by changing the heading of FLIGHT1 to reduce the conflict with FLIGHT2.

responded: The adjustments have further reduced the conflicts, but there is still one remaining conflict between **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**:

- **Heading Difference**: 150.0 degrees
- **Vertical Separation**: 125.7 ft
- **tLOS**: 53.74 seconds

Let's make one more heading adjustment for **FLIGHT3** to increase the separation further.

### Proposed Heading Change:
- **FLIGHT3**: Adjust heading to further increase separation from FLIGHT2.

I'll send the command for this adjustment.

responded: The conflict between **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3** persists, but the situation has improved with the heading adjustments. The tLOS is now negative, indicating that the aircraft are moving away from each other, but the vertical separation is still insufficient.

Since we are restricted to heading changes only, and further adjustments might not be effective given the current vertical separation, it might be necessary to reconsider the strategy or allow some time for the aircraft to naturally separate further.

For now, let's continue monitoring to see if the situation resolves itself as the aircraft continue on their adjusted headings. I'll monitor for a shorter duration to check for any improvements.

   - Vertical Separation: 609.98 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 33.61 Nautical miles
   - Time to Lose Separation (tLOS): 154.14 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 172.0 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 1255.54 ft

   - Vertical Separation: 645.56 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 9.36 Nautical miles
   - Time to Lose Separation (tLOS): 154.14 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by resolving the most critical conflict, which is between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 due to the smallest horizontal distance.

### Plan:
- Adjust the heading of FLIGHT2 and/or FLIGHT3 to increase their separation.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT2 to increase the separation from FLIGHT3. I'll send the command to adjust the heading of FLIGHT2.

responded: We have two conflict pairs:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Heading Difference: 90 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 587.06 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 19.25 nautical miles
   - tLOS: 92.26 seconds

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 90 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 626.05 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 32.03 nautical miles
   - tLOS: 92.26 seconds

Since we're only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's adjust the headings to resolve these conflicts.

### Strategy:
- **FLIGHT2** is involved in both conflicts. Adjusting its heading could potentially resolve both conflicts.
- We can change FLIGHT2's heading to either increase the separation or change its path to avoid conflicts.

Let's change the heading of **FLIGHT2** to 200 degrees to see if it resolves the conflicts.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 21.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 165.21 seconds

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 34,700 ft and are level. We are only allowed to change the aircraft heading to resolve these conflicts.

Let's start by addressing the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, as they have the smallest heading difference and the same tLOS as FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. We can try to increase their heading difference to resolve the conflict. 

I'll adjust the heading of FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

responded: We have three aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Heading Difference: 1.0 deg
   - Horizontal Separation: 5.64 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 107.86 sec

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 208.0 deg
   - Horizontal Separation: 26.81 Nautical miles

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 207.0 deg
   - Horizontal Separation: 22.01 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 107.86 sec

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, which has the smallest heading difference and a tLOS of 107.86 seconds. 

I will change the heading of FLIGHT1 slightly to increase the separation.

responded: We have three aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**:
   - Heading Difference: 319.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 187.42 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**:
   - Heading Difference: 240.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 149.53 seconds

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**:
   - Heading Difference: 79.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 187.42 seconds

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 30,200 ft and are level. Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by addressing the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, as it has the shortest time to lose separation (tLOS).

### Plan:
- Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT3 to increase their separation.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT1 to avoid the conflict with FLIGHT3. A heading change of about 20 degrees should help increase separation.

### Command:
- Change the heading of FLIGHT1 to 369 degrees (349 + 20).

Let's send the command.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**:
   - Heading Difference: 79.0 degrees

### Next Steps:
- Since FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 still have a relatively short tLOS, let's adjust FLIGHT3's heading to further increase separation.
- Change the heading of FLIGHT3 by 20 degrees to the right.

responded: The heading change for FLIGHT3 has improved the situation, but FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3 are still in conflict, albeit with increasing separation. The negative tLOS indicates they are moving apart, but we need to ensure they maintain separation.

### Next Steps:
- Further adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to ensure they continue to separate.
- Change the heading of FLIGHT3 by another 20 degrees to the right.

### Command:
- Change the heading of FLIGHT3 to 189 degrees (169 + 20).

Let's send the command.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Heading difference of 0 degrees, meaning they are on the same path.

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 28,300 ft and are level.

### Resolution Strategy
Since we can only change the heading, we will adjust the headings of the aircraft to resolve the conflicts:

- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2** are heading towards each other. We can change the heading of either one to avoid conflict.
- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT3** are also heading towards each other. We can change the heading of either one to avoid conflict.
- **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3** are on the same path. We can change the heading of either one to avoid conflict.

Let's start by changing the heading of **FLIGHT1** to avoid conflicts with both **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT3**. Then, we'll adjust **FLIGHT2** to resolve its conflict with **FLIGHT3**.

### Commands
1. Change **FLIGHT1** heading to 110 degrees.

responded: We have two aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 45.36 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 228.68 seconds

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 19.38 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 228.68 seconds

Since we are allowed to only change the aircraft heading, let's adjust the headings of FLIGHT2 to resolve both conflicts. 

I'll change the heading of FLIGHT2 to create separation from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3. Let's send a command to change the heading of FLIGHT2.

responded: We have three aircraft in conflict: FLIGHT1, FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT3. All of them are at the same altitude of 21,900 ft, and they have a heading of 247 degrees. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Horizontal distance decreasing from 9.12 to 8.76 nautical miles, with a tLOS of 113.45 seconds.
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Horizontal distance decreasing from 0.6 to 0.46 nautical miles, with a tLOS of -365.62 seconds (indicating they are already in conflict).
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Horizontal distance decreasing from 9.72 to 9.22 nautical miles, with a tLOS of 113.45 seconds.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, I will adjust the headings to resolve these conflicts. Let's start by changing the heading of FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 to separate them from each other and from FLIGHT2. 

I'll send the following commands:
- Change FLIGHT1's heading to 257 degrees.
- Change FLIGHT3's heading to 237 degrees.

responded: We have the following aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 145.81 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 172.1 seconds

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 145.81 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's address these conflicts by adjusting the headings.

### Strategy:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT2 to increase the separation.
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT3 to increase the separation.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Adjust the heading of FLIGHT2 or FLIGHT3 to increase the separation.

Let's start by changing the heading of FLIGHT1 to reduce conflicts with both FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees

Given the operator's preference to only change aircraft heading, let's start by addressing the conflict with the shortest time to lose separation (tLOS), which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3. 

We'll adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to resolve this conflict. Let's change FLIGHT3's heading slightly to avoid the conflict.

responded: We have six aircraft pairs in conflict. Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's address these conflicts one by one, starting with the pair with the shortest time to lose separation (tLOS).

### Current Conflicts:
1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 114.22 sec
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 114.22 sec
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 130.34 sec
4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 139.44 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 109.27 sec
6. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 96.1 sec

Let's start resolving the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4 as it has the shortest tLOS. 

### Proposed Solution:
- **FLIGHT2**: Current Heading = 146°
- **FLIGHT4**: Current Heading = 027°

To resolve the conflict, we can adjust the heading of FLIGHT4 to increase the separation. Let's change FLIGHT4's heading to 010°.

### Command:

responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - tLOS: 46.79 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 4.0 degrees

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - tLOS: 71.06 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 124.0 degrees

3. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: 
   - tLOS: 83.32 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 195.0 degrees

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - tLOS: 46.79 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 120.0 degrees

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start resolving the conflicts by adjusting the headings of the aircraft with the shortest tLOS first.

### Plan:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT2 to increase the separation.
- **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Adjust the heading of FLIGHT2 or FLIGHT3 to increase the separation.

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. I'll change the heading of FLIGHT1 slightly to the right to increase separation.

responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - TCPA: 108.65 sec
   - Heading Difference: 128.0 deg
   - Vertical Separation: 720.42 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 13.07 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 67.19 sec

2. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**
   - TCPA: 238.53 sec
   - Heading Difference: 198.0 deg
   - Vertical Separation: 767.85 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 19.49 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 138.55 sec

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - TCPA: 108.65 sec
   - Heading Difference: 41.0 deg

   - Horizontal Distance: 11.92 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 67.19 sec

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - TCPA: 64.41 sec
   - Heading Difference: 111.0 deg
   - Vertical Separation: 2240.03 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 9.71 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 82.93 sec

Given the operator's preference to only change aircraft heading, let's resolve the conflicts starting with the pair with the shortest tLOS, which is **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**.

### Plan:
- Change the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT4 to increase their separation.
  
Let's start by changing the heading of FLIGHT1 to avoid conflict with FLIGHT4. We'll adjust FLIGHT1's heading slightly to the right by 20 degrees.

   - TCPA: 119.72 sec
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 deg
   - Vertical Separation: 1990.01 ft

Since we are allowed to only change the aircraft heading, I will start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT2 to resolve these conflicts. I'll adjust FLIGHT2's heading by 30 degrees to the right.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - TCPA: 109.55 seconds
   - tLOS: 62.22 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 90 degrees

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - TCPA: 74.37 seconds
   - tLOS: 13.32 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 0 degrees

3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - TCPA: 109.55 seconds
   - tLOS: 62.22 seconds
   - Heading Difference: 90 degrees

Since the operator has requested to only use heading changes, let's address the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 first, as it has the shortest tLOS of 13.32 seconds.

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:
- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Since both aircraft have the same heading (270 degrees), we can change the heading of FLIGHT1 to avoid the conflict.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT1 to 260 degrees to resolve the conflict with FLIGHT3.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**.

### Proposed Solution:
- **FLIGHT1**: Change heading to avoid conflict with FLIGHT3.
- **FLIGHT3**: Change heading to avoid conflict with FLIGHT1.

Let's adjust the headings of FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 to resolve their conflict. We'll change the heading of FLIGHT1 slightly to the left and FLIGHT3 slightly to the right to increase their separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 30.6 sec
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 130.59 sec
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 194.2 sec

5. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 264.8 sec
6. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 222.38 sec

Let's start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4 since it has the shortest tLOS. We can change the heading of one or both aircraft to increase their separation. 

### Proposed Heading Changes:
- **FLIGHT1**: Current Heading = 021°
- **FLIGHT4**: Current Heading = 059°

To resolve the conflict, let's change FLIGHT1's heading to 011° and FLIGHT4's heading to 049° to increase their separation.

responded: The heading adjustment for FLIGHT3 has improved the separation with FLIGHT2, but conflicts still persist:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: -30.3 seconds

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: -54.94 seconds

The DCPA for both conflicts is now above the required 5 nautical miles, indicating that the conflicts are effectively resolved in terms of separation distance. However, the negative tLOS values indicate that the aircraft have already passed the point of closest approach.

Let's confirm the resolution by monitoring the airspace for a longer duration to ensure no further conflicts arise.

   - Heading Difference: 212.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 178.23 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 21.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 178.23 seconds

5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 204.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 173.63 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, I'll start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4. Let's adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to increase the separation.

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees

Given the operator's preference to only change aircraft heading, I will start by resolving the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, as it has the shortest tLOS. I will adjust the heading of FLIGHT3 to create separation.

responded: We have the following aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Heading difference of 180 degrees, indicating they are heading towards each other.
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: Same heading, indicating they are on the same path.
3. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Heading difference of 180 degrees, indicating they are heading towards each other.
4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: Same heading, indicating they are on the same path.
5. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: Heading difference of 180 degrees, indicating they are heading towards each other.

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 34,200 ft and are level.

Since we are allowed to only change the aircraft heading, let's start resolving the conflicts by changing the headings of the aircraft pairs with the smallest tLOS (time to lose separation).

### Resolving Conflicts

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS is negative, indicating they are already in conflict. Let's change the heading of FLIGHT4 to avoid immediate conflict.
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS is 102.14 seconds, change heading of FLIGHT4 to avoid conflict with FLIGHT2 as well.

4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: Heading difference of 0 degrees, tLOS 50.43 seconds.
5. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: Heading difference of 180 degrees, tLOS 76.82 seconds.

Let's start resolving the conflicts with the shortest tLOS first, which is between **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**. Since their headings are the same, we can change the heading of either aircraft to resolve this conflict. I'll change the heading of FLIGHT1 slightly to create separation.

responded: We have four aircraft pairs in conflict, and we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading to resolve these conflicts. Here are the details:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 224.27 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 60.76 seconds

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: 
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 195.53 seconds

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: 
   - Heading Difference: 0.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 224.27 seconds

The most urgent conflict to address is between **FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3** due to the shortest tLOS of 60.76 seconds. We will change the heading of one of these aircraft to resolve this conflict. Let's change the heading of **FLIGHT1** to avoid the conflict. 

Let's proceed with sending the command to change the heading of FLIGHT1.

5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**:
   - Horizontal Distance: 5.65 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 17.24 seconds

6. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**:
   - Horizontal Distance: 1.99 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 348.37 seconds

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 29,100 ft and have the same heading of 046 degrees. Since we are only allowed to change the heading, let's address the conflict with the shortest tLOS first, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4, I will change the heading of FLIGHT4. Let's adjust FLIGHT4's heading to 030 degrees to create separation.

responded: We have six aircraft pairs in conflict, all at the same altitude of 26,900 feet and with no heading difference. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS 135.3 seconds
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS 117.36 seconds
3. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS 253.85 seconds

5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS -147.9 seconds (already in conflict)
6. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS -372.89 seconds (already in conflict)

Since we can only change the heading, I will start resolving the conflicts with the shortest tLOS first. Let's address the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, which has the shortest tLOS of 117.36 seconds. I will change the heading of FLIGHT3 to resolve this conflict.

Since the heading changes have not been effective in resolving the conflicts, I will need to reassess the situation and consider alternative heading adjustments for the aircraft involved. Let's try changing the heading of FLIGHT2 to further separate it from the other aircraft.

responded: We have six aircraft pairs in conflict, all at the same altitude of 14,300 feet and with a heading of 166 degrees. The conflicts are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: TCPA of 412.49 seconds, tLOS of 141.3 seconds.
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: TCPA of 84.44 seconds, tLOS of -852.29 seconds.

6. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: TCPA of 546.17 seconds, tLOS of 164.47 seconds.

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.

### Plan:
- Change the heading of FLIGHT1 or FLIGHT3 to create separation.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT1 to 150 degrees to create horizontal separation from FLIGHT3.

responded: We have the following aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - Heading Difference: 270.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 35.1 seconds

2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 118.2 seconds

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 50.13 seconds

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - tLOS: 35.1 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the heading, let's start by resolving the conflict with the shortest time to lose separation (tLOS), which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, and FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4.

### Proposed Actions:
- Change the heading of **FLIGHT2** to create separation from both FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4.

Let's proceed with changing the heading of FLIGHT2.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: Heading difference is 90 degrees, with a tLOS of 226.68 seconds.
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: Heading difference is 90 degrees, with a tLOS of 226.68 seconds.
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: Heading difference is 90 degrees, with a tLOS of 194.18 seconds.
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: Heading difference is 180 degrees, with a tLOS of 80.95 seconds.

The most urgent conflict is between **FLIGHT2** and **FLIGHT4** due to the smallest tLOS. Let's resolve this conflict first by changing the heading of one or both aircraft.

### Proposed Solution:
- Change the heading of **FLIGHT2** slightly to avoid the conflict with **FLIGHT4**.

Let's send a command to change the heading of **FLIGHT2**.

Command executed successfully.

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - TCPA: 114.43 sec
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 deg

Since we can only change the heading, let's start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4. We can adjust the heading of one or both aircraft to increase their separation.

Let's change the heading of FLIGHT2 to avoid the conflict with FLIGHT4. We'll adjust FLIGHT2's heading slightly to the right.

   - Distance: 10.22 Nautical miles
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 10.22 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 67.01 seconds

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - Distance: 29.14 Nautical miles
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 29.14 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 67.01 seconds

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 90.0 degrees
   - Distance: 9.61 Nautical miles
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 9.61 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 50.03 seconds

4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - Heading Difference: 180.0 degrees
   - Distance: 15.07 Nautical miles
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft
   - Horizontal Distance: 15.07 Nautical miles
   - tLOS: 224.67 seconds

Since we are only allowed to change the aircraft heading, let's start by resolving the conflict with the shortest tLOS, which is between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4. 

Let's adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to increase the separation. I'll change FLIGHT1's heading by 20 degrees to the right.
