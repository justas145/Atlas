FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 are heading in the same direction as FLIGHT4.', 'num_ac': 4, 'conflict_formation': 'Head-On Formation'}`


**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** 
  AIRCRAFT_A is positioned north of AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D, maintaining the same altitude as the other aircraft. AIRCRAFT_B is located south of AIRCRAFT_A and is on the same altitude level, heading in the opposite direction to AIRCRAFT_A. AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_D are positioned closer to each other, with AIRCRAFT_C being slightly to the north of AIRCRAFT_D, both heading in the same direction as AIRCRAFT_B. All aircraft are maintaining a level altitude with no vertical movement.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation

```  
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 2600 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A separated it vertically from AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D, which were all at the same altitude, thus resolving the head-on conflict with AIRCRAFT_B.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 1400 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_C created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_D from AIRCRAFT_A, which was already at a higher altitude, further resolving the conflict.

3 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 3400 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Further decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_C ensured additional vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, enhancing safety margins and preventing any potential conflict with AIRCRAFT_D, which was slightly south of AIRCRAFT_C.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the conflict information and past experience, here's the actionable plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Increase altitude to 36800 ft. This will create vertical separation from FLIGHT2, FLIGHT3, and FLIGHT4.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Decrease altitude to 32800 ft. This will create vertical separation from FLIGHT1 and further separate from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4.
3. **FLIGHT4**: Decrease altitude to 30800 ft. This will ensure additional vertical separation from FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, enhancing safety margins.

**Monitoring value**: 65 seconds

This plan ensures that all aircraft have sufficient vertical separation, resolving the conflicts without introducing new ones.

AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned closely to each other, and both are aligned in the same direction as AIRCRAFT_D, with AIRCRAFT_C slightly trailing behind. The aircraft are all heading in the same direction, maintaining a consistent track and heading with no deviation. None of the aircraft are ascending or descending, as they all have a vertical speed of zero, indicating level flight.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```  
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and the other aircraft, reducing the risk of collision in the parallel formation.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was effective as it increased vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and the other aircraft, further mitigating the conflict by ensuring AIRCRAFT_C was at a different altitude.

3 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 4000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was beneficial because it moved AIRCRAFT_D to an even higher altitude, ensuring it was well clear of AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, thereby resolving the conflict by maximizing vertical separation.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.To resolve the conflicts among the aircraft, I will use a combination of altitude and heading changes based on the operator's preference and the experience from similar conflicts. Here's the actionable plan:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Change heading to 244 degrees to create horizontal separation from FLIGHT3.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Increase altitude to 33700 ft to create vertical separation from FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Change heading to 104 degrees to create horizontal separation from FLIGHT1.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Decrease altitude to 29700 ft to create vertical separation from FLIGHT2.

**Monitoring value**: 50 seconds

This plan ensures both vertical and horizontal separation, adhering to the operator's preference and resolving the conflicts without introducing new ones.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are both positioned at the same altitude, maintaining level flight. AIRCRAFT_A is located to the west of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are on a collision course, with AIRCRAFT_A heading northeast and AIRCRAFT_B heading north. Neither aircraft is ascending or descending, as both maintain a steady altitude.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was effective because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, which were both initially at the same altitude and on a collision course. By decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A, the risk of collision was mitigated by ensuring that the two aircraft were no longer at the same flight level.

2 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command further increased the vertical separation between the two aircraft. By increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B, it ensured that AIRCRAFT_B was at a higher flight level than AIRCRAFT_A, thereby reinforcing the vertical separation and ensuring a safe distance between the two aircraft.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.To resolve the remaining conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3, I will apply the experience from a similar conflict and adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Decrease altitude to 30700 ft to create vertical separation from FLIGHT3.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Increase altitude to 32700 ft to further ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT1.

This plan should resolve the conflict by providing the necessary vertical separation between the two aircraft.

responded: There is a new conflict detected between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3. The current conflict details are as follows:

- **FLIGHT2**: Altitude 33700 ft, Heading 354, Vertical Speed 0 fpm (level)
- **FLIGHT3**: Altitude 32416.13 ft, Heading 104, Vertical Speed 2175 fpm (ascending)

  - Distance: 3.49 Nautical miles
  - Vertical Separation: 1283.88 ft
  - Horizontal Distance: 3.49 Nautical miles
  - tLOS: 6.03 sec

Since the conflict involves a converging formation with insufficient vertical separation, I will search the experience library for similar conflicts and then resolve it.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned in close proximity at the same altitude, indicating they are flying at the same flight level. Both aircraft are maintaining a steady altitude without any ascent or descent. AIRCRAFT_A is heading slightly to the left of AIRCRAFT_B's path, while AIRCRAFT_B is heading slightly to the right of AIRCRAFT_A's path. Their trajectories suggest they are converging towards a similar point.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft effectively separated the vertical flight paths of the two aircraft, reducing the risk of collision as they were initially at the same altitude and converging towards a similar point.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft further increased the vertical separation between the two aircraft, ensuring that they no longer shared the same flight level and thus resolving the conflict by preventing convergence at the same altitude.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT3, I will apply the experience from a similar conflict and adjust the altitudes to ensure vertical separation:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Increase altitude to 34700 ft to create vertical separation from FLIGHT3.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current altitude of 32416.13 ft as it is still ascending to reach the previously assigned altitude of 32700 ft.

This plan should resolve the conflict by providing the necessary vertical separation between the two aircraft.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned south of the other aircraft and is maintaining a level altitude. It is heading northward, while AIRCRAFT_B, positioned north of AIRCRAFT_A, is descending and heading southeast. AIRCRAFT_C is also north of AIRCRAFT_A and is descending with a southeast heading, slightly more eastward than AIRCRAFT_B. AIRCRAFT_D, positioned northeast of AIRCRAFT_A, is descending and heading further southeast than AIRCRAFT_C, maintaining a similar heading to AIRCRAFT_C.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2148 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because AIRCRAFT_B was descending and heading southeast, which could have led to a potential conflict with AIRCRAFT_A. By decreasing its altitude, AIRCRAFT_B was able to safely pass below AIRCRAFT_A, reducing the risk of collision.

2 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 1852 ft | Do's  
   Reason: AIRCRAFT_C was also descending and heading southeast, similar to AIRCRAFT_B. By increasing its altitude, AIRCRAFT_C was able to avoid converging with AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, ensuring vertical separation and preventing a conflict.

3 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 3003 ft | Do's  
   Reason: AIRCRAFT_D, positioned northeast of AIRCRAFT_A and descending with a southeast heading, needed to be separated from AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_B. By decreasing its altitude significantly, AIRCRAFT_D was able to pass below both AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_B, maintaining safe separation and resolving the conflict.  
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.To resolve the conflicts between the aircraft, I will use a combination of altitude and heading changes, taking into account the similar conflict experience and the current situation:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude and heading.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Decrease altitude to 12500 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3.
3. **FLIGHT3**: Increase altitude to 17500 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4.
4. **FLIGHT4**: Decrease altitude to 14000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT3 and maintain separation from FLIGHT2.

These changes will ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between the aircraft in conflict.

**Monitoring value**: 50 seconds (This accounts for the largest altitude change of 2000 ft, which will take approximately 50 seconds to complete.)

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned slightly south of AIRCRAFT_C and is maintaining its altitude, while AIRCRAFT_C is descending. Both are heading in the same direction. AIRCRAFT_B is located to the south of AIRCRAFT_A and is also descending, following the same general heading as AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_C. AIRCRAFT_D is positioned further south of AIRCRAFT_B and is descending as well, with all aircraft maintaining parallel headings.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2028 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command helped to create vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, which were both on similar headings and could have conflicted as AIRCRAFT_B was descending.

2 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 1127 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was effective in preventing a potential conflict with AIRCRAFT_A, which was maintaining its altitude, by increasing the vertical separation as AIRCRAFT_C was descending.

3 | Decrease heading of AIRCRAFT_A by 19 deg | Don'ts  
   Reason: This command was not helpful because changing the heading of AIRCRAFT_A did not address the vertical separation issues with AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, which were the primary concerns in the conflict.

4 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 2200 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command successfully resolved the conflict by increasing vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and the descending AIRCRAFT_C, as well as AIRCRAFT_B, which was also descending and positioned south of AIRCRAFT_A.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2515 ft | Do's | This command helped increase the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, reducing the risk of collision as AIRCRAFT_B was descending and AIRCRAFT_A was at a lower altitude.
2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 122 ft | Do's | This command provided a slight adjustment to AIRCRAFT_C's descent, ensuring it maintained safe separation from AIRCRAFT_B, which was slightly ahead and also descending.
3 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 1478 ft | Do's | This command helped AIRCRAFT_D avoid descending into the path of AIRCRAFT_A, which was at a lower altitude, thus maintaining safe vertical separation.
4 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1900 ft | Don'ts | This command was not helpful as it brought AIRCRAFT_A even closer to the descending paths of AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, increasing the risk of conflict.
5 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2251 ft | Don'ts | This command was not helpful because it did not provide sufficient separation from AIRCRAFT_A, which was already at a lower altitude, and it conflicted with the previous successful altitude adjustment for AIRCRAFT_B.
6 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 3515 ft | Do's | This command was effective in creating a safe vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_A, as it ensured AIRCRAFT_B descended further away from the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A.
7 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 4515 ft | Do's | This command further increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, ensuring that AIRCRAFT_B was well below AIRCRAFT_A's altitude, thus resolving the conflict.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the current situation and the insights from the experience library, here's the actionable plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Decrease altitude to 24000 ft. This will increase the vertical separation from FLIGHT1 and ensure safe separation from FLIGHT3.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current descent to reach 27000 ft. This will ensure it remains safely above FLIGHT2 and below FLIGHT4.
3. **FLIGHT4**: Increase altitude to 29000 ft. This will ensure it remains above FLIGHT3 and maintains safe vertical separation from all other aircraft.

**Monitoring Value**: 75 seconds

This plan ensures that all aircraft have sufficient vertical separation and resolves the conflicts without introducing new ones.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3 has been resolved as there is now a vertical separation of 2000 ft between them. However, there is a new conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. The vertical separation is only 1728.2 ft, which is below the required 2000 ft, and the horizontal distance is 5.55 nautical miles, which is below the required 5 nautical miles.

I will now search the experience library for similar conflicts to help resolve this new conflict.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned relatively close to each other, with AIRCRAFT_A slightly to the east of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are maintaining the same heading and track, moving in a westerly direction. AIRCRAFT_A is maintaining a level altitude, while AIRCRAFT_B is descending. The aircraft are aligned in the same direction, indicating parallel flight paths.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1800 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1800 ft was effective in resolving the conflict because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B. Since AIRCRAFT_B was descending, this command ensured that AIRCRAFT_A was at a higher altitude, thus avoiding any potential collision as they moved in parallel flight paths.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we can adapt the solution from the experience library:

1. **FLIGHT1**: Continue descending to 25000 ft as previously instructed.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Increase altitude to 26000 ft. This will ensure a safe vertical separation from FLIGHT1 as it descends.

This plan will provide the necessary vertical separation to resolve the conflict without introducing new ones.

1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and the other aircraft, reducing the risk of collision in the parallel formation.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was effective as it increased vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and the other aircraft, further mitigating the conflict by ensuring AIRCRAFT_C was at a different altitude.

3 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 4000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was beneficial because it moved AIRCRAFT_D to an even higher altitude, ensuring it was well clear of AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, thereby resolving the conflict by maximizing vertical separation.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the current conflict and the guidance from the experience library, here is the plan to resolve the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Continue ascending to 26000 ft as previously instructed. This will ensure a safe vertical separation from FLIGHT1.
2. **FLIGHT3**: Descend to 25000 ft to create vertical separation from FLIGHT2 and FLIGHT4.
3. **FLIGHT4**: Increase altitude to 31000 ft to ensure vertical separation from FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT2.

These adjustments will provide the necessary vertical separation to resolve the conflicts without introducing new ones.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned relatively close to each other, with AIRCRAFT_A slightly to the east of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are maintaining the same heading and track, moving in a westerly direction. AIRCRAFT_A is maintaining a level altitude, while AIRCRAFT_B is descending. The aircraft are aligned in the same direction, indicating parallel flight paths.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1800 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1800 ft was effective in resolving the conflict because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B. Since AIRCRAFT_B was descending, this command ensured that AIRCRAFT_A was at a higher altitude, thus avoiding any potential collision as they moved in parallel flight paths.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the guidance from the experience library and the current situation, here's the plan to resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT3:

2. **FLIGHT3**: Maintain current altitude of 25000 ft.

These adjustments will provide the necessary vertical separation to resolve the conflict without introducing new ones.

responded: The conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 has been resolved as the vertical separation is now 800 ft, which is less than the required 2000 ft, but the tLOS is negative, indicating that they are moving apart. The horizontal separation is 2.37 nautical miles, which is less than the required 5 nautical miles, but the DCPA is increasing, indicating that they are moving apart.

Since the conflict is resolving itself, I will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that no new conflicts arise. Let's monitor the airspace for a longer duration to confirm that the conflict is indeed resolved.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 aircraft are involved in the conflict. The call signs for reference are AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D.

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the south of the other aircraft and is maintaining its altitude, heading northward. AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C are closely aligned in position and altitude, both descending and heading northward. AIRCRAFT_D is further south compared to AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, also descending and heading northward. All aircraft, except AIRCRAFT_A, are aligned in their heading and track, indicating a parallel flight path.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2036 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, which were closely aligned in position and altitude, reducing the risk of collision.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 36 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful as it further increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_B, ensuring that both aircraft maintained a safe distance while descending on a parallel flight path.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.FLIGHT2 descend to 25064 ft

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are both positioned at the same altitude, flying level without any vertical movement. AIRCRAFT_A is located to the southwest of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are heading directly towards each other, with AIRCRAFT_A moving eastward and AIRCRAFT_B moving westward. Neither aircraft is ascending or descending, maintaining a stable altitude throughout the conflict.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation

```  
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 2000 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, which were previously at the same altitude and on a collision course. By increasing AIRCRAFT_A's altitude, the risk of collision was mitigated as the aircraft were no longer in the same flight level.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned in close proximity at the same altitude, indicating they are flying at the same flight level. Both aircraft are maintaining a steady altitude without any ascent or descent. AIRCRAFT_A is heading slightly to the left of AIRCRAFT_B's path, while AIRCRAFT_B is heading slightly to the right of AIRCRAFT_A's path. Their trajectories suggest they are converging towards a similar point.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft effectively separated the vertical flight paths of the two aircraft, reducing the risk of collision as they were initially at the same altitude and converging towards a similar point.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft further increased the vertical separation between the two aircraft, ensuring that they no longer shared the same flight level and thus resolving the conflict by preventing convergence at the same altitude.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 aircraft are involved in the conflict: AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D.

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the southeast of AIRCRAFT_B and is maintaining a level altitude, while AIRCRAFT_B is descending and moving in a southwest direction relative to AIRCRAFT_A. AIRCRAFT_C is further north and descending, heading in a south-southwest direction, and is positioned northwest of AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B. AIRCRAFT_D is positioned northeast of AIRCRAFT_C and is descending, moving in a southwest direction relative to AIRCRAFT_C. All aircraft are converging towards a common area from different directions, with AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_C having a perpendicular heading difference.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```plaintext
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2061 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was helpful because AIRCRAFT_B was descending and moving southwest, converging towards AIRCRAFT_A. By decreasing its altitude, the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B was increased, reducing the risk of conflict.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 1937 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was helpful as AIRCRAFT_C was descending and heading south-southwest, converging towards the area where AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B were located. By decreasing its altitude, AIRCRAFT_C was provided with additional vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, contributing to resolving the conflict.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned in close proximity at the same altitude, indicating they are flying at the same flight level. Both aircraft are maintaining a steady altitude without any ascent or descent. AIRCRAFT_A is heading slightly to the left of AIRCRAFT_B's path, while AIRCRAFT_B is heading slightly to the right of AIRCRAFT_A's path. Their trajectories suggest they are converging towards a similar point.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft effectively separated the vertical flight paths of the two aircraft, reducing the risk of collision as they were initially at the same altitude and converging towards a similar point.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft further increased the vertical separation between the two aircraft, ensuring that they no longer shared the same flight level and thus resolving the conflict by preventing convergence at the same altitude.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the conflict report and the operator's preference to use both altitude and heading changes, I will provide a new plan to resolve the conflict.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are both positioned at the same altitude, flying level without any vertical movement. AIRCRAFT_A is located to the southwest of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are heading directly towards each other, with AIRCRAFT_A moving eastward and AIRCRAFT_B moving westward. Neither aircraft is ascending or descending, maintaining a stable altitude throughout the conflict.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation

```  
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 2000 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, which were previously at the same altitude and on a collision course. By increasing AIRCRAFT_A's altitude, the risk of collision was mitigated as the aircraft were no longer in the same flight level.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D are positioned south of AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, with all aircraft maintaining a similar heading and track. AIRCRAFT_A is at a lower altitude compared to the other aircraft and is maintaining level flight, while AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D are descending. All aircraft are heading in the same direction, indicating they are on parallel courses. The aircraft are in close proximity vertically and horizontally, with AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_C being particularly close in both aspects.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1833 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was effective because it increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, which was crucial since AIRCRAFT_A was at a lower altitude. By descending AIRCRAFT_B, it reduced the risk of collision with AIRCRAFT_A, which was maintaining level flight.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 200 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command helped by slightly increasing the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_A, which were particularly close both vertically and horizontally. The small descent ensured that AIRCRAFT_C maintained a safe distance from AIRCRAFT_A while continuing its descent.

3 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 270 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was beneficial as it further increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_D and AIRCRAFT_A. Since AIRCRAFT_D was descending, reducing its altitude helped to maintain a safe distance from AIRCRAFT_A, which was at a lower altitude and on a parallel course.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.Based on the conflict report and the suggested solutions, I will provide an actionable plan to resolve the conflicts.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the southwest of AIRCRAFT_B and is heading northeast, while AIRCRAFT_B is positioned to the northeast of AIRCRAFT_A and is heading southeast. AIRCRAFT_C is positioned to the southeast of AIRCRAFT_A and is heading northeast, while AIRCRAFT_D is positioned to the southeast of AIRCRAFT_A and is heading northeast as well. All aircraft are maintaining the same altitude and are level, with no changes in vertical speed. AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D are on a converging path, as are AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, with all aircraft maintaining their respective headings.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2000 ft created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, which were on converging paths, thus reducing the risk of collision.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 2000 ft provided vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_B, which was also on a converging path with AIRCRAFT_C, effectively resolving the conflict between these two aircraft.

3 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 4000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 4000 ft ensured that it was at a higher altitude than AIRCRAFT_A, which was on a converging path with AIRCRAFT_D. This command provided sufficient vertical separation to resolve the conflict between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 aircraft are involved in the conflict. The call signs for reference are AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D.

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the south of the other aircraft and is maintaining its altitude, heading northward. AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C are closely aligned in position and altitude, both descending and heading northward. AIRCRAFT_D is further south compared to AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, also descending and heading northward. All aircraft, except AIRCRAFT_A, are aligned in their heading and track, indicating a parallel flight path.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2036 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, which were closely aligned in position and altitude, reducing the risk of collision.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 36 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful as it further increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_B, ensuring that both aircraft maintained a safe distance while descending on a parallel flight path.
```

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 4 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, AIRCRAFT_D)

- **Relative Conflict Description:**  
  AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D are positioned to the south of AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, with AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D maintaining a northward heading while AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C head southward. AIRCRAFT_A is maintaining its altitude, while AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C, and AIRCRAFT_D are descending. AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D are aligned in the same direction, whereas AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C are aligned opposite to them. The aircraft are positioned such that AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_D are on a parallel path, while AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C are on a parallel descending path towards the south.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation

```plaintext
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2768 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful as it increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, reducing the risk of collision in the head-on formation.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 4770 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was effective because it further increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_C and AIRCRAFT_A, ensuring a safer passage by creating a greater altitude difference in the head-on conflict.

3 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_D by 443 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful as it allowed AIRCRAFT_D to maintain a safe vertical distance from AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, which were descending, thus preventing any potential conflict as they crossed paths.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are both positioned at the same altitude, flying level without any vertical movement. AIRCRAFT_A is located to the southwest of AIRCRAFT_B. Both aircraft are heading directly towards each other, with AIRCRAFT_A moving eastward and AIRCRAFT_B moving westward. Neither aircraft is ascending or descending, maintaining a stable altitude throughout the conflict.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation

```  
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 2000 ft | Do's  
Reason: This command was helpful because it created vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B, which were previously at the same altitude and on a collision course. By increasing AIRCRAFT_A's altitude, the risk of collision was mitigated as the aircraft were no longer in the same flight level.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B are positioned in close proximity at the same altitude, indicating they are flying at the same flight level. Both aircraft are maintaining a steady altitude without any ascent or descent. AIRCRAFT_A is heading slightly to the left of AIRCRAFT_B's path, while AIRCRAFT_B is heading slightly to the right of AIRCRAFT_A's path. Their trajectories suggest they are converging towards a similar point.

- **Conflict Formation:** Converging Formation

```
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1000 ft effectively separated the vertical flight paths of the two aircraft, reducing the risk of collision as they were initially at the same altitude and converging towards a similar point.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft | Do's | Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1000 ft further increased the vertical separation between the two aircraft, ensuring that they no longer shared the same flight level and thus resolving the conflict by preventing convergence at the same altitude.

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 3 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, and AIRCRAFT_C are all positioned at the same altitude, flying level without any vertical movement. All three aircraft are heading in the same direction, with identical headings and tracks. AIRCRAFT_A is positioned slightly north of AIRCRAFT_C, while AIRCRAFT_B is positioned further south relative to both AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_C. There is no change in vertical separation as all aircraft maintain a level altitude.

- **Conflict Formation:** Parallel Formation

```plaintext
1 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1300 ft | Do's  
Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1300 ft effectively resolved the conflict by creating vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and the other two aircraft, AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, which remained at the original altitude. This action ensured that AIRCRAFT_A was no longer at the same flight level as the other aircraft, thus eliminating the risk of collision.

2 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 700 ft | Do's  
Reason: Decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 700 ft further enhanced the vertical separation between the aircraft. With AIRCRAFT_A already at a higher altitude, this command ensured that AIRCRAFT_B was positioned below both AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_C, thereby resolving the conflict by establishing clear vertical separation among all three aircraft.
```

Note: This is a similar conflict but not identical. Please use your judgement and adapt the solution to the current situation.FLIGHT1 climb to 17800 ft

**Conflict Report**

- **Number of Aircraft Involved:** 2 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B)

- **Relative Conflict Description:** AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the south of AIRCRAFT_B and is maintaining its altitude, while AIRCRAFT_B is positioned to the north and is descending. AIRCRAFT_A is heading in a northwesterly direction, whereas AIRCRAFT_B is heading in a southeasterly direction. Both aircraft are on opposing courses, directly facing each other. AIRCRAFT_A remains level, while AIRCRAFT_B is descending as they approach each other.

- **Conflict Formation:** Head-On Formation


1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_A by 1700 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command was helpful because it increased the vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_A and AIRCRAFT_B. Since AIRCRAFT_B was descending, lowering AIRCRAFT_A's altitude ensured that the two aircraft were no longer on a collision course, effectively resolving the head-on conflict by creating a safe vertical distance between them.

**Conflict Report**

- Number of Aircraft Involved: 3 (AIRCRAFT_A, AIRCRAFT_B, AIRCRAFT_C)

- Relative Conflict Description: AIRCRAFT_A is positioned to the north of AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C, maintaining a level altitude. AIRCRAFT_B is descending and is located to the south of AIRCRAFT_A, heading northward. AIRCRAFT_C is also descending and is positioned to the west of AIRCRAFT_A, heading southeast. Both AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_C are moving towards AIRCRAFT_A from different directions, with AIRCRAFT_B approaching from the south and AIRCRAFT_C from the west.

- Conflict Formation: Converging Formation

```  
1 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 1799 ft | Do's  
   Reason: This command helped to create vertical separation between AIRCRAFT_B and AIRCRAFT_A, reducing the risk of collision as AIRCRAFT_B was approaching from the south while descending.  
   
2 | Increase altitude of AIRCRAFT_C by 2000 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Increasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_C helped to establish vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_A, as AIRCRAFT_C was approaching from the west while descending. This maneuver ensured that AIRCRAFT_C passed above AIRCRAFT_A, avoiding a potential conflict.  
   
3 | Decrease altitude of AIRCRAFT_B by 2799 ft | Do's  
   Reason: Further decreasing the altitude of AIRCRAFT_B ensured an even greater vertical separation from AIRCRAFT_A, which was crucial as AIRCRAFT_B continued its northward approach. This command reinforced the safety margin established by the first command.
