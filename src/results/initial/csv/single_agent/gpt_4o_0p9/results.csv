**Solution:**

Let's separate them vertically by changing the altitude of KL204.

**Command:**
- Change KL204's altitude to 27,000 feet (a 2,000 feet separation).

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG KL820 140'}`
responded: Despite the efforts to change headings and altitudes, the conflict between BZ221 and KL820 continues to persist. The distance between them is not sufficient to resolve the conflict completely.

### Final Attempt:

I will attempt to create a larger horizontal separation by making a more significant heading change for one of the aircraft. 

I will change KL820's heading to a more divergent direction.

Let's execute this final command.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'HDG BZ221 150'}`
responded: The conflict between BZ221 and KL820 still persists, but the situation has improved with increased horizontal separation.

Considering the improvements:

1. **Change of Heading for BZ221:** Let's adjust BZ221's heading a bit more to attempt to create even better horizontal separation.

### Command:
1. Change heading of BZ221.

Let's execute this command.

The conflicts have been resolved by changing the altitudes of the aircraft to ensure vertical separation of 2000 feet:
- KL7002 was changed to 22000 ft.
- KL7004 was changed to 18000 ft.
- KL7006 was changed to 22000 ft.
- KL7008 was changed to 18000 ft.

After monitoring, no conflicts were detected.

All conflicts are now resolved.

responded: Let's review the aircraft details and issue commands to resolve the conflicts:

1. **Conflict between KL5501 and KL5503:**
   - DCPA: 0.46 Nautical miles

2. **Conflict between KL5501 and KL5505:**
   - DCPA: 0.00 Nautical miles

3. **Conflict between KL5503 and KL5507:**
   - DCPA: 0.46 Nautical miles

Next step is to get the exact details of each aircraft to decide on altitude or heading adjustments. Then, we will resolve the conflicts accordingly.

responded: ### Aircraft Positions and Headings:
1. **KL5501:**
   - Position: N10'38'52.0"" E010'00'0.0""
   - Heading: 180°
   - Altitude: 30000 ft

2. **KL5503:**
   - Position: N10'00'0.0"" E010'38'51.0""
   - Heading: 270°
   - Altitude: 30000 ft

3. **KL5505:**

4. **KL5507:**
   - Position: N10'00'0.0"" E009'01'3.0""
   - Heading: 090°
   - Altitude: 30000 ft

Since all aircraft are at the same altitude of 30,000 ft, we can resolve the conflict by either changing heading or changing altitude.

### Proposed Solutions:
1. **Conflict between KL5501 and KL5503:**
   - Change heading of KL5503 by 20° to 290° to increase horizontal separation.

2. **Conflict between KL5501 and KL5505:**
   - Change heading of KL5505 by 20° to 020° to increase horizontal separation.

3. **Conflict between KL5503 and KL5507:**
   - Change heading of KL5503 by 20° to 290° (already initiated in step 1, so no additional action needed).

Let's implement these changes.
