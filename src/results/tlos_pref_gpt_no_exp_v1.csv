responded: The tLOS for the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 is now 359.82 seconds, which is below the threshold of 400 seconds. I can now proceed to resolve the conflict.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Altitude 16,700 ft (level)
- **FLIGHT2**: Altitude 17,140.79 ft (descending)

### Resolution Plan:
To resolve the conflict, I will adjust the altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft.

1. **FLIGHT1**: Maintain current altitude of 16,700 ft.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Descend to 18,700 ft to ensure a vertical separation of 2,000 ft.

Let's implement these changes.

responded: Currently, there is one pair of aircraft in conflict:

- **FLIGHT1** and **FLIGHT2** are both at an altitude of 23,800 ft, with no vertical separation and a horizontal distance of approximately 47.1 nautical miles. The time to lose separation (tLOS) is 1032.6 seconds, which is greater than the 400-second threshold.

Since the tLOS is greater than 400 seconds, I will continue monitoring until the tLOS decreases below 400 seconds before taking any action.

responded: The tLOS for the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 is now 378.09 seconds, which is below the 400-second threshold. I can now take action to resolve the conflict. 

Given that both aircraft are at the same altitude of 20,800 feet, I will adjust their altitudes to ensure vertical separation. Let's ascend FLIGHT1 to 22,800 feet and descend FLIGHT2 to 18,800 feet to achieve the required 2,000 feet vertical separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS is 843.27 seconds.
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS is 843.27 seconds.

Both conflicts have a tLOS greater than 400 seconds, so we need to wait until the tLOS is less than 400 seconds before resolving these conflicts. Let's continue monitoring the airspace to fast forward the time.

responded: The tLOS for the conflict pair **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2** is now 355.34 seconds, which is less than 400 seconds. I will resolve this conflict by adjusting their altitudes to ensure vertical separation.

- **FLIGHT1** is currently at 19300 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** is descending and is currently at 19601.88 ft.

To resolve the conflict, I will instruct **FLIGHT2** to descend to a lower altitude to achieve the required vertical separation.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - tLOS: 957.71 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 625.75 ft

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 957.71 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 699.78 ft

Both pairs have a tLOS greater than 400 seconds, so we need to wait until the tLOS is less than 400 seconds before we can start resolving the conflicts. I will continue monitoring the airspace until the tLOS is less than 400 seconds.

responded: The conflicts have evolved, and now there are three aircraft pairs in conflict with tLOS less than 400 seconds:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - tLOS: 359.52 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**

   - Vertical Separation: 650 ft

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 376.54 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 650 ft

To resolve these conflicts, I will adjust the altitudes to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2000 ft between each pair.

- **FLIGHT1** is currently at 26800 ft.
- **FLIGHT2** is currently at 26800 ft.
- **FLIGHT3** is currently at 27450 ft.

I will adjust the altitudes as follows:
- **FLIGHT1**: Maintain at 26800 ft.
- **FLIGHT2**: Climb to 28800 ft.
- **FLIGHT3**: Climb to 30800 ft.

Let's send the commands to resolve the conflicts.

FLIGHT3: Altitude 26300.0 ft -> 26300.0 ft (level)
Invoking: `CONTINUEMONITORING` with `{'duration': 20}`
responded: Currently, there are three aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS is 784.33 seconds.
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS is 784.33 seconds.
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS is 1027.06 seconds.

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 26,300 ft and are level.

Since the tLOS for all pairs is greater than 400 seconds, I will continue monitoring until the tLOS for any pair is less than 400 seconds.

responded: Currently, there are two aircraft pairs in conflict:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: 
   - Time to Loss of Separation (tLOS): 914.46 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: 
   - Time to Loss of Separation (tLOS): 914.46 seconds
   - Vertical Separation: 0 ft

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 28,000 ft and are level. Since the tLOS for both pairs is greater than 400 seconds, I will continue monitoring until the tLOS is less than 400 seconds.

responded: There are currently six aircraft pairs in conflict. However, according to the guidelines, we can only start solving conflicts when tLOS is less than 400 seconds. Let's analyze the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 1190.86 sec
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 1523.17 sec
3. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 13.39 sec
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 991.42 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 943.41 sec
6. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 991.42 sec

Only the conflict between **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4** has a tLOS less than 400 seconds. Let's resolve this conflict first. 

### Aircraft Altitude Information:
- **FLIGHT1**: 30700 ft (level)
- **FLIGHT2**: 31488.92 ft (descending)
- **FLIGHT3**: 32219.15 ft (descending)
- **FLIGHT4**: 31369.94 ft (descending)

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT3 and FLIGHT4, we need to ensure a vertical separation of 2000 ft or a horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles. Since both aircraft are descending, I will adjust their altitudes to achieve vertical separation. 

Let's change FLIGHT3 to ascend to 34000 ft and FLIGHT4 to descend to 30000 ft.

responded: The tLOS for the aircraft pair FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4 is now 383.96 seconds, which is below the threshold of 400 seconds. I can now proceed to resolve this conflict. 

Given the current altitudes:
- FLIGHT1: 34,300 ft (level)
- FLIGHT4: 35,443.71 ft (descending)

To resolve the conflict, I will adjust the altitude of FLIGHT1 to ensure a vertical separation of at least 2,000 ft. I will instruct FLIGHT1 to descend to 32,300 ft.

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**
   - tLOS: 1101.28 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft

2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**
   - tLOS: 1071.36 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft

3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 822.7 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft

4. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**

   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft

5. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**
   - tLOS: 1101.28 sec
   - Vertical Separation: 0.0 ft

All aircraft are currently at the same altitude of 25,100 ft. I will continue monitoring the airspace until the tLOS for any pair is less than 400 seconds, at which point I will take action to resolve the conflict.

Invoking: `SENDCOMMAND` with `{'command': 'ALT FLIGHT4 24100'}`
responded: The conflict information has been updated, and now one pair has a tLOS less than 400 seconds:

- **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 347.54 sec

All aircraft are still at the same altitude of 22,100 ft and are level. I will now resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4 by adjusting their altitudes to ensure vertical separation. Let's proceed with the altitude adjustments.

Command executed successfully.
Invoking: `CONTINUEMONITORING` with `{'duration': 20}`
responded: The commands to change the altitudes of FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT4 have been successfully executed. However, it seems the conflict information has not yet updated to reflect these changes. I'll monitor the airspace again to ensure the conflict is resolved.

responded: Currently, there are six aircraft pairs in conflict, and all aircraft are at the same altitude of 29,300 ft. The conflicts and their respective tLOS values are as follows:

1. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 903.49 sec
2. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 1017.64 sec
3. **FLIGHT3 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 808.79 sec
4. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 1148.11 sec
5. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 1061.16 sec
6. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 1148.11 sec

Since the guideline allows solving conflicts only when tLOS is less than 400 seconds, I will continue monitoring the airspace until the tLOS for any pair is less than 400 seconds.

responded: Currently, there are four aircraft pairs in conflict, but all have a tLOS greater than 400 seconds. Here's a summary of the conflicts:

1. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT2**: tLOS = 1099.56 sec
2. **FLIGHT2 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 1099.56 sec
3. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT3**: tLOS = 930.7 sec
4. **FLIGHT1 - FLIGHT4**: tLOS = 1125.78 sec

All aircraft are at the same altitude of 21,700 ft.

Since the tLOS for all conflicts is greater than 400 seconds, I will continue monitoring until the tLOS is less than 400 seconds for any pair.
